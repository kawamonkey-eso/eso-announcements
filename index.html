				<h2>Endless Archive</h2> 
				<p>In the Endless Archive, you can discover an unending challenge as you battle your way through the shifting libraries and twisting pathways of one of Hermaeus Mora's most mysterious strongholds.</p> 
				<p>A malignant force is causing chaos within the once solemn archive, and its custodian, Master Malkhest, needs brave explorers to investigate and fight back against the corruption. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/10/4f5eb2f67d03541aa8697d37debdc896.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Battle through the Archive</i></p> 
				<p><b>Unending Challenge</b></p> 
				<p>In this all-new PvE activity, you can team up with a trusted ally or go it solo as you contend with randomly generated stages filled with waves of monsters and perilous boss encounters. </p> 
				<p>The further you progress into this eternal arena, the more dangerous and numerous your foes become. Fall to the Archive's dangers three times, and your run ends, plus you have to start over. But don't let that phase you, as there's always another expedition into the Endless Archive waiting, and the greater the dangers, the greater the rewards are in turn! </p>
				<img src="https://esossl-a.akamaihd.net/uploads/Community/Article/Achievement_ELAR_ThoatReplicanum_GlassMantikoraCombat%20%201%20.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Survive twisted maligraphies</i></p> 
				<p>Helping you survive these encounters are two types of boons you can choose along the way: Verses (temporary buffs that last until the end of the next Stage), and Visions (more permanent buffs that last your entire run). The Verses and Visions you choose can have a major impact on your run, so choose wisely! </p> 
				<p><b>Infinite Rewards</b></p> 
				<p>As you continue your expedition into the Endless Archive, you can discover and unlock a host of specials rewards, including unique collectibles, item sets, and more—all granted by the Prince of Knowledge himself! </p> 
				<p>These rewards include class set items, the first of their kind, which provide powerful boons to select Class Skill Lines. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Empower class skills with new item sets</i></p> 
				<p>However, that's not all. As you complete expeditions, you also earn a new currency called Archival Fortunes. With Archival Fortunes, you can purchase all manner of helpful items from the vendors within the Endless Archive's central hub. This includes one-time use buffs, individual item set items, fragments of collectibles, and even permanent account unlocks that provide boons for future runs! </p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Endless Archive collectible rewards</i></p> 
				<p>Finally, the Endless Archive also features a host of unique in-game collectibles that you can't earn anywhere else in Tamriel or Oblivion, including the Maligraphic Mount, Maligraphic Skeever pet, a unique Tales of Tribute deck, and much more. Check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/64891">our preview</a> for more information on the Endless Archive's rewards.</p> 
				<h2>Getting Started</h2> 
				<p>The Endless Archive is a <b>free</b> base-game addition to <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i> and is part of the Update 40 patch. There is no additional purchase necessary, although ESO Plus members will enjoy a bonus to Archival Fortune gains during their expeditions. </p> 
				<p>You can access the Endless Archive via two methods:</p> 
				<ul><li>If you own the Necrom Chapter, you can find the entrance to the Endless Archive northeast of Cipher's Midden in Apocrypha.</li><li>If you don't own the Chapter, select the Endless Archive icon on your map of Apocrypha to teleport directly there.</li></ul>

				<p style="text-align: center"><i>Prepare for adventure</i></p> <p>Brave adventurers may wish to dive right in to the archive's myriad mazelike passages, but you may wish to review these <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/64837;">developer tips</a> before you begin your expedition. Preparation is key—good luck!</p> <h2>Update 40 </h2> <p>In addition to the new PvE activity, Update 40 also includes a host of new features and quality-of-life improvements that all of Tamriel's adventurers can enjoy.</p><p><b>Japanese Console Text Localization</b></p><p> </p><p>Update 40 is fully localized for Japanese players on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. These new translations have been added for both past and all future releases, including the base game, previous DLCs and Chapters, and the most-recent <i>Necrom</i> Chapter. To enable Japanese localization for your console, download the Update 40 patch and check your console's language settings. </p><p> </p> <p><b>Group Finder</b></p> <p>The new Group Finder tool makes it easier than ever to find likeminded players to join you for practically any in-game activity, including typical group challenges such as Trials or Dungeon runs, but also more social activities such as zone explorations, roleplay sessions, or fashion contests! </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/10/0f2f8e781eacee9f7a7a165c6b2e4019.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Group Finder UI</i></p> 
				<p>There are a host of categories you can choose from when finding a group, but the Custom category allows you to create or find fellow players for any unique activity you can dream up! </p> 
				<p>In addition, the Group Finder allows you to set up requirements for your groups, including roles, CP levels, voice chat, and many more. </p> 
				<p><b>Grand Master Crafting Stations</b></p> 
				<p>Update 40 also introduces a new type of end-game furnishing for Tamriel's master crafters: Grand Master Crafting Stations. These special items allow you to consolidate your home's (likely many) attuned crafting stations into one, severely reducing the amount of housing slots your crafting stations take up AND freeing up space in general. The more attuned crafting stations you “feed” to your Grand Master station, the more visually distinct that specific furnishing will appear as it evolves over time. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/10/ed2a0be2d781a7eb96a51f70e780978c.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center"><i>Grand Master Crafting Stations</i></p> <p>You can acquire Grand Master Crafting Stations using Writ Vouchers from the Achievement Mediator, Faustina Curio, with a unique furnishing available for each of Blacksmithing, Jewelry Crafting, Clothing, and Woodworking. </p> <p>You can dive deeper into both the Group Finder and Grand Master Crafting Stations in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/64897">this preview blog</a>. </p> <p><b>Jewelry Crafting Rebalance</b></p> <p>This patch also establishes a broad rebalancing of Jewelry Crafting to help align its costs with the game's other crafting disciplines. This includes the removal of Jewelry Crafting grains and conversion into platings in addition to increasing the total boosters needed to upgrade your jewelry. As a result, upgrading rings and amulets is now easier and cheaper than ever before.</p> <p><b>Quest XP &amp; Gold Standardization</b></p> <p>Finally, Update 40 also standardizes the Experience Point and Gold rewards for many of the game's quests, including those associated with zones, main storylines, prologues, dailies, guild storylines, and more. This will result in more consistent rewards for the game's various quests based on their complexity or length. </p> <p>Of course, these are just some of the changes implemented with the base-game patch. Be sure to visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/patch-notes">Patch Notes forum</a> to review everything coming with this massive update. </p> <h2>Endless Challenges</h2> <p>In the Update 40 base-game patch, you can discover an all-new challenge for you and your fiercest allies as you delve ever-deeper into the dynamic galleries of a corrupted library. How far will your expedition into the Endless Archive get? The only limits are your preparation and skills!

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
				In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
				Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a target="_blank" href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
				If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
				We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.

				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/08/2aae9b31906a3c66e2128b4d1cf5b7d1.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Update 39 Base Game Improvements</i></p> 
				<p>As a base-game patch, Update 39 includes a wide array of bug fixes, but also features a series of long-awaited improvements to your in-game experience. </p> 
				<p><b>Quest &amp; Content Improvements for New Players</b></p> 
				<p>If you're a new player feeling overwhelmed when first entering Tamriel, you can enjoy a series of changes that <b>reduce the volume and frequency of quests </b>offered to your low-level characters. This includes quests from NPCs for the main story, Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, Battlegrounds, Undaunted, and others. Instead, these quests are now delivered more gradually as you level up, helping your journal stay in a manageable state for longer!</p> 
				<p>Tamriel's navigator NPCs that can transport your characters between destinations have also received some improvements with this update. Now, these navigators <b>indicate whether they can transport you to a location for one of your tracked quests</b> (active or inactive.) When exploring, you now see the “door” pin above relevant navigator NPCs, indicating that they can help you in your journey. In addition, appropriate dialog lines with those same NPCs have similar pins, ensuring you make the right choice and go where you need to go—happy travels! </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/08/71d1ea150e994d1d9a33e1959bbe5942.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Taking your first steps into Tamriel is daunting</i></p> 
				<p><b>Inventory Management Improvements</b></p> 
				<p>If you're struggling with an overburdened Inventory, Update 39 also includes changes to key item types to help improve management and reduce clutter. Some (but not all) similar Crown Store items that came from separate sources (such as Tri-Restoration Potions) can now all be <b>stacked together using the “Stack All Items” option</b>. Also, this patch adds <b>better communication regarding which items in your Inventory can or cannot be sold</b>, helping you identify and clear out unwanted items and make a little gold in the process!</p> 
				<p><b>PvP Additions &amp; New Rewards </b></p> 
				<p>This update adds new rewards for Tamriel's PvP victors in the form of <b>three new monster mask sets</b>: Jerall Mountains Warchief, Nibenay Bay Battlereeve, and Colovian Highlands General. Each grants unique and powerful boons, and you can trade Alliance Points for these new masks with Cyrodiil Elite Gear Vendors within the Eastern Elsweyr Gate, Southern High Rock Gate, and Northern Morrowind Gate. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/07/02adb5389ad204fbd8e6c9ce6240f7d4.png" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Chase down new PvP rewards</i></p> 
				<p>In addition, you can now claim <b>new Unfeathered Battle Body and Face Markings</b> from Gladiator's Rucksacks (earned by completing Cyrodiil Conquest Mission Board daily quests), and the Imperial City's hapless <b>Treasure Scamps now</b> <b>drop even better loot </b>when hunted down. In particular, Cunning Scamps drop more Tel Var Stones and Trove Scamps drop tradable pieces of Imperial City gear sets. </p> 
				<p>Finally, while battling in Cyrodiil, the Imperial City, and Battlegrounds, you can now see <b>new death notifications</b> that help you plan your next move (or avoid that incoming zerg!).</p> 
				<p><b>Home Editor Improvements</b></p> 
				<p>With Update 39, this patch gives you the ability to <b>place a furnishing directly from your Inventory or Collectibles UI </b>while in your home. You can now find a “Place” option when viewing the specific furnishings. In addition, you can <b>preview Crown Store furnishings</b> in your home before you buy, helping you determine how a new item might look when placed. </p>

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Hi all,<br><br>
				We wanted to give everyone some visibility into a couple of issues we are currently tracking involving the Dungeon Finder.<br><br>
				The first is a recurring issue where some group members appear to be offline after you port into a dungeon or are not ported at all. We've been working on a fix for this that will hopefully make it into U39.<br><br>
				The other issue relates to queueing as a group for a dungeon, specifically as a Tank or Healer. We've seen reports where these roles take longer than intended to get matched into a group, and after some investigating, we found there is indeed a problem here when certain conditions are met. While we work on addressing this, we want to offer some additional information that you can leverage as a workaround in the meantime:<br><ul><li>In 3-person groups:
				<ul><li>Tank, Healer and Direct Damage (DD) combination: If the Tank or Healer is the group lead, the LFG queue times will be significantly longer than if the DD is the group lead.</li>
				<li>2 DD and a Healer, or 2 DD and a Tank: If the Tank or Healer is group lead, the LFG queue times will be slightly longer than if the DD is the group lead, but to a much lesser extent than the Tank/Healer/DD combo above.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>4-person groups do not appear to be impacted by this issue in any way.</li>
				</ul>
				Until we can get a fix for this, we suggest <b>queuing up with the DD as group leader for any 3 person groups</b> so you get through the queues much quicker.<br>
