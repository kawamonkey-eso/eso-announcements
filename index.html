				<p>Morphing collectibles can take many forms over the course of a year. If you're unfamiliar with how they work, you can read more about them in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/guides/eventtickets">this guide</a>. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Molag Bal Illusion Imp Pet</i></p> 
				<p>As has been the case in past years, you'll need to collect three different fragments to summon this specific collectible:</p> 
				<p>· Anchor Chain Fragment</p> 
				<p>· Dark Anchor Pinion</p> 
				<p>· Effigy of the Dominator</p> 
				<p>These three fragments will be available for purchase with Event Tickets during each of 2024's major in-game events. Just visit the Impresario during any of her appearances throughout the year to acquire them. Once you have all three fragments, combine them in your Collections to unlock access to this malevolent mite.</p> 
				<p>As a morphing collectible, the Molag Bal Illusion Imp can also be combined with other fragments to summon a different collectible event reward each quarter of this year, starting with the <b>Planemeld's Master Body and Face Markings</b>.</p>

				<p>Greetings everyone—it's time to look back at <i>ESO</i> in 2023 and look forward to 2024.</p> 
				<p>In 2023, our #1 priority—besides shipping <i>Necrom</i> and Infinite Archive—was to make the service more stable. The hardware refresh of all game servers finished in 2023, and even though we have some more non-player-facing hardware swaps to go, we are all reaping the benefits of more modern and powerful servers powering <i>ESO</i>'s infrastructure. We also have refined our processes to ensure that updates launch with fewer issues, and for the great majority of situations, we achieved that. We did have longer downtimes than usual a few times due to the hardware refresh, but looking back, I'm pretty happy with where things are—especially after our Epic Games Store launch in July, where we saw our highest monthly active user numbers since 2015.</p> 
				<p><i>Necrom</i> was our highest-rated Chapter (in some ratings, highest since <i>Summerset</i>), and shows our commitment to amazing storytelling. I'm especially happy with how the Apocrypha zone turned out. Adding to the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> lore on Daedric realms is something we take great pride in, and I think we nailed the combination of obsession with knowledge and creepy visuals that are the hallmark of Hermaeus Mora. And for the first time in a few years, the story will continue in 2024, as the 2023 story (no spoilers here!) ended on a cliffhanger.</p> 
				<p>And wrapping up 2023, we launched Infinite Archive, adding a challenging, repeatable game mode to <i>ESO</i>. This is a type of content that we want to do more of in the future: really fun, challenging experiences with great rewards that players can enjoy for a long time. <i>ESO</i> is always about great storytelling, so we won't abandon story quests and content, but we will balance it out with more systems like dungeons, trials, and special new content like Infinite Archive.</p> 
				<p>Looking forward to 2024, the obvious first thing to note is that April 4, 2024, is <i>ESO</i>'s 10-year anniversary, marking a decade since we launched on PC/Mac. Reaching this milestone with the game in such great shape will be an amazing achievement—and we will celebrate with both in-game and real-life events. You already know about the first two: our 10-Year Anniversary community event in Amsterdam in April and a 10-Year Anniversary-themed <i>ESO </i>Tavern in Germany from July 13-14. Stay tuned for more information about all these events, and I certainly hope to see you in person at one or more of them!</p> 
				<p>Also, I remind you that April 4, 2024, is the 10-year anniversary of the PC/Mac launch, but many of you didn't join the community until June 2015, at <i>ESO</i>'s massive console launch. As such, we are considering the entirety of April 2024 through July 2025 as our 10-year anniversary period, and we will fill it as much as we can with special events, retrospectives, and lots of other fun stuff to celebrate you, our community, and the <i>ESO</i> dev team. We can't wait to share all of this with you when we are ready.</p> 
				<p>Next year will kick off with a Global Reveal show in January, and we are excited to continue the story from last year but in a different part of Tamriel. It's going to be great, and we have some new systems that I think everyone will want to hear about. I'm not going to spoil it now, but you should definitely look out for the Global Reveal announcement and mark your calendars!</p> 
				<p>Finally, I'd like to take a moment to talk about all of us in the <i>ESO</i> community. Now that we are a year or so past the pandemic, it's good to take stock of where we are and where we want to go.</p> 
				<p><i>ESO</i> is in a great place—enjoyed by millions. In fact, almost two million of you joined <i>ESO</i> last year, not counting the players enjoying the game for free from the Epic Games Store. We have been massively successful for many years now, and we are very thankful for all of you who have helped make this happen. As we approach the 10th anniversary of this amazing experience, I would just like everyone to acknowledge the path we've been on and appreciate the hard work we have all done to keep <i>ESO</i> amazing. It takes a village to develop and operate a game like this, and that village absolutely includes everyone reading this right now. Thanks so much for everything you do for <i>ESO</i>.</p> 
				<p>See you in Tamriel!</p>

				<h2>Celebrating 10 Amazing Years</h2> 
				<p>Next year, <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i> will reach its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary since it first launched on PC/Mac in April 2014. To celebrate this incredible milestone, we're kicking off a massive 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Celebration in April.</p>

				<p>Whether you've been a member of the #ESOFam since early beta, have recently begun your journey into Tamriel, or are looking for a new epic online roleplaying game—you won't want to miss this incredible celebration. It all kicks off next year in Amsterdam!</p> 
				<h2>Join Us in Amsterdam</h2> 
				<p>The fun begins next year with the first <i>ESO</i> 10-Year Celebration Event, a two-day in-person event we're hosting at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sugarfactory.nl/en/">SugarFactory</a> just outside of Amsterdam, Netherlands, from Friday, April 5, until Saturday, April 6.

				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/10/93b563f90ddef66e9abade33ebe4014a.jpg" /><p><i>Discover the Update 40 base-game patch, featuring the unending battle of the Infinite Archive and more, now live on all platforms! </i><br></p> <p><i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Infinite Archive</i> and Update 40 are now live on PC/Mac, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.<br></p> <p>This base-game patch introduces an all-new PvE activity for Tamriel's adventurers and a host of new features and quality-of-life improvements—completely free for all <i>ESO </i>players! This update also fully localizes the game for Japanese players on Xbox and PlayStation consoles. This includes localization for the base game, all previous DLCs and Chapters, <i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom</i>, and this most recent patch. </p>

				<h2>Infinite Archive</h2> 
				<p>In the Infinite Archive, you can discover an unending challenge as you battle your way through the shifting libraries and twisting pathways of one of Hermaeus Mora's most mysterious strongholds.</p> 
				<p>A malignant force is causing chaos within the once solemn archive, and its custodian, Master Malkhest, needs brave explorers to investigate and fight back against the corruption. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/10/4f5eb2f67d03541aa8697d37debdc896.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Battle through the Archive</i></p> 
				<p><b>Unending Challenge</b></p> 
				<p>In this all-new PvE activity, you can team up with a trusted ally or go it solo as you contend with randomly generated stages filled with waves of monsters and perilous boss encounters. </p> 
				<p>The further you progress into this eternal arena, the more dangerous and numerous your foes become. Fall to the Archive's dangers three times, and your run ends, plus you have to start over. But don't let that phase you, as there's always another expedition into the Infinite Archive waiting, and the greater the dangers, the greater the rewards are in turn! </p>
				<img src="https://esossl-a.akamaihd.net/uploads/Community/Article/Achievement_ELAR_ThoatReplicanum_GlassMantikoraCombat%20%201%20.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Survive twisted maligraphies</i></p> 
				<p>Helping you survive these encounters are two types of boons you can choose along the way: Verses (temporary buffs that last until the end of the next Stage), and Visions (more permanent buffs that last your entire run). The Verses and Visions you choose can have a major impact on your run, so choose wisely! </p> 
				<p><b>Infinite Rewards</b></p> 
				<p>As you continue your expedition into the Infinite Archive, you can discover and unlock a host of specials rewards, including unique collectibles, item sets, and more—all granted by the Prince of Knowledge himself! </p> 
				<p>These rewards include class set items, the first of their kind, which provide powerful boons to select Class Skill Lines. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/09/5e802a1ba276c8d61c4afe1758e10e1a.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Empower class skills with new item sets</i></p> 
				<p>However, that's not all. As you complete expeditions, you also earn a new currency called Archival Fortunes. With Archival Fortunes, you can purchase all manner of helpful items from the vendors within the Infinite Archive's central hub. This includes one-time use buffs, individual item set items, fragments of collectibles, and even permanent account unlocks that provide boons for future runs! </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/10/8e6903a91a99738393994927036ff658.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Infinite Archive collectible rewards</i></p> 
				<p>Finally, the Infinite Archive also features a host of unique in-game collectibles that you can't earn anywhere else in Tamriel or Oblivion, including the Maligraphic Mount, Maligraphic Skeever pet, a unique Tales of Tribute deck, and much more. Check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/64891">our preview</a> for more information on the Infinite Archive's rewards.</p> 
				<h2>Getting Started</h2> 
				<p>The Infinite Archive is a <b>free</b> base-game addition to <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i> and is part of the Update 40 patch. There is no additional purchase necessary, although ESO Plus members will enjoy a bonus to Archival Fortune gains during their expeditions. </p> 
				<p>You can access the Infinite Archive via two methods:</p> 
				<ul><li>If you own the Necrom Chapter, you can find the entrance to the Infinite Archive northeast of Cipher's Midden in Apocrypha.</li><li>If you don't own the Chapter, select the Infinite Archive icon on your map of Apocrypha to teleport directly there.</li></ul>

				<p style="text-align: center"><i>Prepare for adventure</i></p> <p>Brave adventurers may wish to dive right in to the archive's myriad mazelike passages, but you may wish to review these <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/64837;">developer tips</a> before you begin your expedition. Preparation is key—good luck!</p> <h2>Update 40 </h2> <p>In addition to the new PvE activity, Update 40 also includes a host of new features and quality-of-life improvements that all of Tamriel's adventurers can enjoy.</p><p><b>Japanese Console Text Localization</b></p><p> </p><p>Update 40 is fully localized for Japanese players on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. These new translations have been added for both past and all future releases, including the base game, previous DLCs and Chapters, and the most-recent <i>Necrom</i> Chapter. To enable Japanese localization for your console, download the Update 40 patch and check your console's language settings. </p><p> </p> <p><b>Group Finder</b></p> <p>The new Group Finder tool makes it easier than ever to find likeminded players to join you for practically any in-game activity, including typical group challenges such as Trials or Dungeon runs, but also more social activities such as zone explorations, roleplay sessions, or fashion contests! </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/12/209feb4dae2118a1fbaf13641f6af6ae.png" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Group Finder UI</i></p> 
				<p>There are a host of categories you can choose from when finding a group, but the Custom category allows you to create or find fellow players for any unique activity you can dream up! </p> 
				<p>In addition, the Group Finder allows you to set up requirements for your groups, including roles, CP levels, voice chat, and many more. </p> 
				<p><b>Grand Master Crafting Stations</b></p> 
				<p>Update 40 also introduces a new type of end-game furnishing for Tamriel's master crafters: Grand Master Crafting Stations. These special items allow you to consolidate your home's (likely many) attuned crafting stations into one, severely reducing the amount of housing slots your crafting stations take up AND freeing up space in general. The more attuned crafting stations you “feed” to your Grand Master station, the more visually distinct that specific furnishing will appear as it evolves over time. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center"><i>Grand Master Crafting Stations</i></p> <p>You can acquire Grand Master Crafting Stations using Writ Vouchers from the Achievement Mediator, Faustina Curio, with a unique furnishing available for each of Blacksmithing, Jewelry Crafting, Clothing, and Woodworking. </p> <p>You can dive deeper into both the Group Finder and Grand Master Crafting Stations in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/64897">this preview blog</a>. </p> <p><b>Jewelry Crafting Rebalance</b></p> <p>This patch also establishes a broad rebalancing of Jewelry Crafting to help align its costs with the game's other crafting disciplines. This includes the removal of Jewelry Crafting grains and conversion into platings in addition to increasing the total boosters needed to upgrade your jewelry. As a result, upgrading rings and amulets is now easier and cheaper than ever before.</p> <p><b>Quest XP &amp; Gold Standardization</b></p> <p>Finally, Update 40 also standardizes the Experience Point and Gold rewards for many of the game's quests, including those associated with zones, main storylines, prologues, dailies, guild storylines, and more. This will result in more consistent rewards for the game's various quests based on their complexity or length. </p> <p>Of course, these are just some of the changes implemented with the base-game patch. Be sure to visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/patch-notes">Patch Notes forum</a> to review everything coming with this massive update. </p> <h2>Endless Challenges</h2> <p>In the Update 40 base-game patch, you can discover an all-new challenge for you and your fiercest allies as you delve ever-deeper into the dynamic galleries of a corrupted library. How far will your expedition into the Infinite Archive get? The only limits are your preparation and skills!

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Investigate the Daily Login Rewards alongside Mizzik</i></p><p>Even the most stylish of investigators sometimes needs a break from casework, and so Mizzik Thunderboots has found himself in need of a place to hang up his signature hat.

				<p>As handsome as these rewards are, they comprise only a few of the login rewards available in <i>ESO</i> next month. You can view the complete list in the Daily Rewards section of the in-game Crown Store on November 1! Which reward are you most looking forward to? Do you plan to Sit and Drink beside Mizzik Thunderboots, or has one of the items available for Seals of Endeavor caught your eye?

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
				In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
				Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a target="_blank" href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
				If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
				We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Hello everyone! After plenty of testing <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/discussion/632782/new-eso-launcher-testing-and-launch-plan-pc-and-mac">during the last PTS period</a>, we are pleased to announce the rollout of our new patcher on the live servers for PC/Mac. The rollout of the new patcher will happen in four phases, with new countries being added during each phase. As we give countries access to the new patcher, we will make note of it in the list below by noting next to the country name (has the new patcher.) We will also note what phase we are currently in by specifying whether it has not started, in progress, or complete, next to the phase number. The countries getting the patcher are listed in order below.<br><br>
				Thanks for your patience as we roll this out to all countries listed below. A special thanks to everyone who helped test out the launcher during the last PTS and provided feedback.<br><br><b>Phase 1 (Complete) </b>

				<li>Audio issues with sound volume and sound effects. We have a bug in for this and are working on a fix for the future.</li>
