				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Hi all, we currently have taken down access to PTS. We encountered an issue with PTS once the server went live. This has also caused an issue with the PC NA live server, so we will be temporarily taking down the PC NA live server as well. Once we have more information, we will update everyone. Thanks for your patience as we begin investigations.,Hi everyone, just wanted to let you know investigations are ongoing. To set expectations as we head into the evening, we're looking at several hours of downtime. We'll let you know when we have an update to share.,Just checking in to let everyone know investigations are continuing, and both PC NA and PTS will remain under maintenance until further notice. We'll provide another update in an hour or two regardless of the status.,Hi everyone,<br><br>
				Thanks for your patience while we investigated the issues affecting PC NA and the PTS. As some of you discovered, we ran into a problem where character saves on the PTS were affecting PC NA, and we locked both PTS and PC NA immediately. We have temporarily locked the affected accounts until we can restore them to a good state and will be notifying those players via email, and will be rolling back progress on PC NA from those accounts to April 15th at 9:30am EDT. This will take several days to complete and we will alert any affected players when their account is accessible again.<br><br>
				To be clear, the rollback will primarily affect accounts that logged onto the PTS after maintenance on April 15th.<br><br>
				Please note if your account is affected, when you attempt to log into your account on any realm you will see a message saying your account was suspended/banned. Rest assured this is not the case and it is simply how our system identifies locked accounts.<br><br>
				The current plan is to bring PC NA back online within the hour, followed by the PTS later in the day.<br><br>
				We will follow up in the coming days with more details summarizing what happened and will share any additional information at that time. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and thank you again for your patience during this matter.<br>,Hi everyone,<br><br>
				We'd like to start off by saying we know this situation is upsetting and we recognize many of you are angry. To say we're disappointed this happened is an understatement and we empathize with those that are still locked out of their accounts. Just know we are working around the clock on this and will share more information about what happened and what we plan to do to make things right later this week.<br><br>
				Today, the first priority is getting the PTS back online which should be finished in the next few hours. We will then focus on going through all the affected accounts to get everyone their accounts back as quickly as possible. We also want to clarify that any ill-gotten gains from this issue, such as items and all currency that may have been distributed, will be removed from the economy.<br><br>
				Thanks for sticking with us and we'll let you know when the PTS is back online.<br>,Just wanted to let everyone know as of 5:10pm EDT, the PTS is back online. We are continuing to work on all affected accounts that are currently locked or need to be rolled back, and we will provide the next update in the morning (eastern time). Thanks for the ongoing patience and understanding while we work through this issue.,Good morning everyone,<br><br>
				As promised, we'd like to share an update to the PC NA server downtime we had Monday night.<br><br>
				First, to acknowledge that many of you lost playtime in the middle of an event, we will extend the Anniversary Jubilee event by two days on PC NA and EU to allow you a little extra time to obtain any items or event tickets. This puts the new end date for PC realms on April 25 at 9:59am EDT. Additionally, all PC NA players will be granted an extra 200 Seals of Endeavor.<br><br>
				For those who are still blocked from logging in, we are continuing to work on resolving the locked accounts and a small number of accounts will be unlocked later today. To set expectations, unlocking the remaining accounts and performing the necessary rollbacks will require server downtime and at that point, all remaining accounts will be unlocked at the same time. The <i>soonest </i>this will occur is by the end of the week but we will keep you posted on the timeline.<br><br>
				To that end, for anyone whose accounts have been affected by this issue and are currently locked or being rolled back, we will be emailing you an ESO game code so you can play ESO (either on the Live servers or the PTS) while you wait for your main account. Please note that this is not in any way intended to replace your current account, and we are continuing to work around the clock to restore all affected accounts. We are also discussing some additional in-game items we'd like to send to those that have their accounts locked, which we will share very soon.<br><br>
				Thanks again for your continued patience and understanding.,Just want to make sure this line was seen:<br><blockquote>
				<div>We are also discussing some additional in-game items we'd like to send to those that have their accounts locked, which we will share very soon.</div>
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				The game code and event extension is not the only thing we plan to do to make things right for those with locked accounts. We hope to share these details in the next day or so.,Hi All, we just wanted to clarify that everyone identified with a locked account as a result of the PTS issues - with the exception of a handful of players who seriously exploited - will receive future communication about additional in-game items.<br><br>,<blockquote>

				Hi, everyone. We have completed the restoration work for the small number of accounts mentioned in the quote above. Those players have received an email notifying them that their accounts are now restored and available. Work on the rest is ongoing, and we will have another update for you tomorrow. Thank you for your continued patience.,As mentioned in our <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/comment/8091825/#Comment_8091825">post</a> yesterday, we plan to provide some additional in-game items for those that had their accounts locked due to this issue. This is in addition to the Anniversary Jubilee extension for all PC players until April 25 at 9:59am EDT, and the 200 Seals of Endeavor for PC NA players that were affected from the sudden downtime Monday evening.<br><br>
				The items we plan to grant to the accounts that were locked are as follows:
				<ul><li>16,000 Seals of Endeavor</li>
				<li>5x Glorious Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes</li>
				<li>Trueflame Replica Style Page</li>
				<li>Staff of Worms Replica Style Page</li>
				<li>Barbas Helmet Replica Style Page</li>
				<li>Sunna'rah Replica Style Page</li>
				<li>Ul'Vor Staff Replica Style Page</li>
				<li>25x Jubilee Confetti Packs</li>
				</ul>
				We do hope this helps lessen the inconvenience this situation has caused. We'll follow up when we know when these items will be delivered to you.<br><br>
				We'd also like to clarify that some locked accounts with an active ESO Plus membership through our account system <i>did </i>have their subscription renewal automatically cancelled; any time left from a current subscription is still active. Please note you will need to manually re-subscribe once you regain access to your account, should you decide to do so. If your subscription was through another storefront including Steam, Xbox or PlayStation, your subscription and renewal are still running. To make up for any lost subscription time, we will be granting one month of ESO Plus (including the crowns) to active ESO Plus subscribers whose accounts were locked as a result of this issue.<br><br>
				In the meantime, work continues on these locked accounts and the associated rollbacks. We hope to have an update on this by the end of the day and will keep you posted.<br>,As an addendum to the above post that details the items we plan to grant to the accounts that were locked, we want to clarify that we will be granting these on both EU <i>and</i> NA for anyone who lost access to their account.,Hi everyone,<br><br>
				As we head towards the weekend, we'd like to give you an update on where we stand with unlocking the remaining accounts. Work is still ongoing for any necessary data restoration and ensuring we remove all items and currency that may have made their way from the PTS to the PC NA server. This is a long and complicated process, and we want to ensure we get it right before moving onto the next step of unlocking these accounts.<br><br>
				On Monday, April 22, we have patches scheduled for both PTS and PC NA/EU. Once those maintenances are complete, we will discuss the best and soonest time to schedule the downtime needed on PC NA to perform the actual rollbacks and subsequently, unlock all remaining accounts. We'll let you know as soon as possible when plans are solidified but expect it to occur early next week. Additionally, the items we plan to grant to these accounts will be delivered at a later date, which we'll announce as soon as we know.<br><br>
				Once again, thank you for your ongoing patience and we'll follow up with everyone on Monday.<br>,Hello everyone,<br><br>
				We completed the scheduled PC maintenance earlier today but maintenance on the PTS is ongoing. Additionally, we are continuing to perform extensive testing to ensure everything is correct once we perform the necessary rollbacks. Due to all this, in addition to already having console maintenance scheduled on Wednesday, currently the <i>earliest </i>we'll be able to schedule the needed maintenance on PC NA for the rollbacks and to unlock accounts is Thursday this week. We'll keep you posted as soon as we know the exact date and time.<br><br>
				In the meantime, given the length of time these accounts have been locked, we will also plan on granting the Cumberland Anniversary Attire costume to affected accounts, currently on day 21 in this month's daily login rewards.<br>,Hi everyone,<br><br>
				Now that all scheduled maintenance has concluded on the PC, PTS and console megaservers, we'd like to outline next steps and what to expect in the coming days:<br><ul><li>Tomorrow, April 25 beginning at 6am EDT, we'll be taking the PC NA megaserver offline for maintenance. During this time, we'll be restoring affected PC NA accounts back to their state from Monday, April 15 at 9:30am EDT.</li>
				<li>Once PC NA maintenance concludes by 2pm EDT, anyone currently with a locked account due to the PTS issue last week, on any server, will once again have access to their accounts. You will also receive an email once your account is unlocked.</li>
				<li>Affected console players will have the items outlined in <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/comment/8093012/#Comment_8093012">this post</a> upon logging into their accounts through in-game mail.</li>
				<li>On Monday, May 6, we will be granting the items outlined in <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/comment/8093012/#Comment_8093012">this post</a> to affected PC NA and EU players, during the scheduled maintenance. Again, these items will be sent and claimed through in-game mail.</li>
				<li>Also on Monday, May 6, we will be granting the one month of ESO Plus with 1650 crowns to those whose accounts have been locked and have an active ESO Plus subscription through the ESO website.
				<ul><li>Note that this time will automatically be added to whatever remaining time you already have.</li>
				<li>For those that subscribe through another storefront including Steam, Xbox or PlayStation, we will keep you posted with any updates.</li>
				</ul></li>
				</ul>
				We'll let everyone know when maintenance is wrapping up tomorrow. Thanks, once again, for your ongoing patience.<br>,Hi all, just to give you a quick update, maintenance is going well and we expect to open soon. We'll post here once the servers are open and accounts have been unlocked. Thanks!,PC NA is opening now and all previously locked accounts are now available. Please let us know if you run into any unexpected issues with your accounts, otherwise we will follow up as we approach the next update on May 6.,Everyone, we need to take PC NA offline to investigate an issue that just surfaced. Please stand by for further updates.,Thanks for everyone's patience with the sudden downtime; we needed to restore the data from a small number of accounts and have successfully done so. We should be re-opening the PC NA megaserver very soon!

				<h2>Thieves of Tamriel </h2> 
				<p>The Thieves Guild Anniversary Spotlight is part of the ongoing 10-Year Anniversary Celebration and begins this Monday, April 15, and continues until Monday, April 29, 2024. If you're the kind of adventurer who enjoys operating on the wrong side of the law, you'll enjoy additional rewards and goods by playing the outlaw during this time. </p> 
				<p>To begin, should you earn (or have already earned) the “Pocket Picker” in-game achievement, you can claim the entire <i>Thieves Guild </i>DLC for free from the in-game Crown Store. Earning the Pocket Picker achievement is as easy as taking a sweetroll from a baby—simply pick the pocket of any citizen of Tamriel. If you're already an adept footpad, you might have not only Pocket Picker, but other achievements progressing from it that change the name in the in-game Achievements menu. Not to worry—should you have moved on to earn “Purse Snatcher” or “Sneak Thief Extraordinaire,” you can claim the <i>Thieves Guild</i> DLC all the same.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/04/4494a70f116fc065381a665b787798e1.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Pick a pocket to unlock a DLC!</i></p> 
				<p>The <i>Thieves Guild</i> DLC grants you access to the Hew's Bane zone, the Thieves Guild organization and storyline, and the Thieves Guild Skill Line, helping you stay one step ahead of the law. </p> 
				<p>Furthermore, <i>Thieves Guild</i> DLC owners can also claim the Treasure Hunter Horse mount for free from the in-game Crown Store by earning the Hew's Bane Cave Delver achievement. To unlock this achievement, simply visit and defeat the bosses within both explorable caves in the Hew's Bane zone. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Treasure Hunter Horse mount</i></p> 
				<h2>Endeavor to Get Rich</h2> 
				<p>During the promotion window (April 15-29), some of the Daily and Weekly Endeavors will feature challenges relevant to both Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood members. For example, a Daily Endeavor may ask you to pick pockets or locks, while another may ask you to use poisons or even the Blade of Woe. Even better, the rewards for these thematic Endeavors will be increased—keep an eye out for them! </p> 
				<h2>Dark Brotherhood Discounted!</h2> 
				<p>If you don't own or have access to the <i>Dark Brotherhood</i> DLC and want to make the most out of the bonus Endeavors, you can acquire it during the promotion window from the Crown Store at 20% off. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/04/67cfd6ca2622f55e78b565419431ed03.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>We know … you'll enjoy this discount!</i></p> 
				<p>The <i>Dark Brotherhood</i> DLC gives you access to the Gold Coast zone, the Dark Brotherhood organization and storyline, and access to both the Blade of Woe ability and the Dark Brotherhood Skill Line—everything an aspiring assassin needs!</p> 
				<h2>Crime Pays</h2> 
				<p>During the Thieves Guild Anniversary Spotlight, you can experience Tamriel on the wrong side of the law for free, simply by picking a pocket—easy! Are you planning a heist or two during this new promotion? Don't forget, this Anniversary Spotlight will take place only between April 15-29—don't miss it!

				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/2986fc33560b70052ac679f2b54a8ffb.jpg" /><p><i>It's ESO's 10<sup>th</sup> birthday and everybody is invited! Find out how to join in the fun as we celebrate 10 years together.</i></p> 
				<h2>ESO Turns Ten!</h2> 
				<p>To celebrate this huge new milestone, the Anniversary Jubilee in-game event is back and better than ever. Kicking off on <b>April 4 at 10AM EDT</b>, the event will continue until <b>April 23 at 10AM EDT</b> as part of a special extended stay. Even better, the +100% XP buff once gained by eating slices of cake is now active throughout the whole event, with no risk of losing the benefits due to ongoing battle or a full stomach.</p> 
				<p>To get started, complete the quest “For Cake's Sake” to earn this year's Jubilee Cake, available from the young Khajiit chef Apprentice Mogh near the docks of Vulkhel Guard, Davon's Watch, and Daggerfall, or found free in Quest Starters section of the in-game Crown Store.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/66fcdf167b0a947d5c0e40ab9429a0d2.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Help Mogh bake a treat</i></p> 
				<p>Once you've acquired the 2024 Jubilee Cake memento, you can earn <b>three event tickets each day</b> by simply using your cake and enjoying a delicious slice. Combine that with this event's special length, and you can earn up to <b>60 event tickets total</b>! </p> 
				<p>And as a reminder, unlike previous years, using the cake is not necessary to keep the +100% XP buff from the event active. Still, don't forget to enjoy a slice of cake every day to get your tickets, and try not to let them get stuck between your teeth!</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/d788eef7d81d058b428388399110172b.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>A new year means a new cake!</i></p> 
				<h2>Big Birthday Boons</h2> 
				<p>The Jubilee Cake isn't the only thing seeing improvements this year. The traditional Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes are changing too. You can now earn Gift Boxes from additional sources, and the first Gift Box you earn from any source each day will be a gold <b>Glorious Anniversary Jubilee Gift Box</b> with incredible rewards. Additional reward boxes will be regular <b>Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes</b>, but don't let that concern you—these boxes give rewards of similar quality to the gold boxes of years past.</p> 
				<p>You can earn Gift Boxes from any of the following sources (bear in mind that only the first Gift Box earned each day will be a Glorious box, no matter where you get it):</p> 
				<ul><li>Any daily quest in the game, as in previous years, including:</li><ul><li>Daily crafting writs</li><li>Daily Delve, World Boss, and Incursion event quests</li><li>Daily Alliance War and Battlegrounds quests</li><li>Daily Dungeon and Trial quests</li><li>Daily Heist and Sacrament quests</li></ul><li>Killing and looting any final Dungeon boss</li><li>Killing and looting any final Trial boss</li><li>Killing and looting any World boss</li><li>Completing any Incursion event, such as a Dark Anchor, Abyssal Geyser, Bastion Nymic, or similar</li><li>Rewards for the Worthy reward mails (the box will appear inside the parcel received)</li><li>A chance from Tales of Tribute reward mails, with a higher chance to receive one based on the challenge of the opponent or the number of opponents face during a daily (the box will appear inside the parcel received)</li></ul> 
				<p>What's in these wonderful boxes, you might ask? In the case of the Glorious Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes available once daily, they contain:</p> 
				<ul><li>Crafting materials</li><li>A motif chapter, furnishing recipe, or style item</li><li><b>New:</b> A tradeable outfit style page for the Earthbone Ayleid armor style</li><li><b>New:</b> A fragment for the new Jubilee Steed mount (note that you need 25 total fragments to make the steed, so keep some Event Tickets ready if you want this one!)</li><li>1 to 10 Transmute Crystals</li><li>Desecrated Grave Soil, the Worm Cult style item</li></ul>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/586990e91467d6e178522d0d85771a56.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>2024 Anniversary Jubilee rewards</i></p> 
				<p>Subsequent boxes earned in a day are Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes and contain:</p> 
				<ul><li>Crafting materials</li><li>A small chance for a motif chapter, furnishing recipe, or style item</li><li>A chance for 1 to 10 Transmute Crystals</li><li>A chance for Desecrated Grave Soil, the Worm Cult style item</li><li>A small chance for a tradeable style page for last year's Bonemold armor style</li><li>Another small chance for a tradeable style page from any of the Bonemold, Saberkeel, or Worm Cult outfit styles</li></ul> 
				<p>That's a treasure trove of rewards in every box, and playing <i>ESO </i>throughout the event can earn you a great many boxes. But that's not all!</p> 
				<p>In addition to the Gift Boxes and the rewards therein, you can also earn new cosmetic rewards that have never before been earnable in game, although they may be familiar to some players.</p> 
				<ul><li>As a small chance from any fishing node during the Jubilee, you may find outfit style pages for the Trueflame Sword Replica. Yes, really!</li><li>Any Dolmen reward chest has a small chance to contain a style page for the Staff of Worms Replica, in recognition (though not honor) of Mannimarco's dark deeds.</li><li>Any World Boss in Vvardenfell has a small chance to drop a style page for either the Sunna'rah Replica or the Barbas Helmet Replica, as seen during that Chapter's story.</li><li>Any Abyssal Geyser trove clam in Summerset has a small chance to drop a style page for the Ul'vor Staff, as seen during that Chapter's story.</li></ul> 
				<h2>Event Tickets and Vendors</h2> 
				<p>When you've got as many Event Tickets as the Jubilee will award, you need things to spend them on. Fortunately, the Impresario came prepared with an extensive stock for her stall. In preparation for this year's festivities, she has filled her inventory with the following items:</p> 
				<ul><li>All three Molag Bal Illusion Imp pet fragments</li><ul><li>Anchor Chain Fragment</li><li>Dark Anchor Pinion</li><li>Effigy of the Dominator</li></ul><li>The first two fragments for the <b>new </b>Master of Schemes personality</li><ul><li>Cold Iron Gauntlet</li><li>Grim Iron Mask</li></ul><li>Bound style pages for the Earthbone Ayleid armor style</li><li>Anniversary Cake furnishings (note that these require you to own the respective year's cake memento to buy!)</li><li>Anniversary Cake Slice furnishings (unlike the full cakes, you do not need to own the respective year's cake memento to buy these!)</li><li>Jubilee Steed mount fragments</li><li>Bags of Jubilee Yesteryear, containing the following, providing only items you do not currently own:</li><ul><li>Bound Worm Cult motif chapters </li><li>Jephrine Paladin armor style pages</li><li>Imperial Champion weapon style pages</li><li>Prophet armor style pages</li><li>Lyris armor style pages</li><li>Sai Sahan armor style pages</li><li>Abnur Tharn armor style pages</li><li>Bound Saberkeel armor style pages</li><li>Bound Bonemold armor style pages</li><li>Aurora Firepot Spider parts (excluding the instructions, which are available from the Impresario's assistant, Philius Dormier)</li><li>Desecrated Grave Soil (note that this is a chance in addition to whatever else the bag contains)</li></ul><li>Group Repair Kits</li><li>Companion Guild Commendations</li></ul>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/0fe7e2881b27f875fd5955e6a61a4b01.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Master of Schemes personality</i></p> 
				<p>All that inventory makes the Impresario quite well-stocked indeed! But what about her assistant, Philius Dormier? In addition to his usual wares, he will be stocking:</p> 
				<ul><li>All three Unstable Morpholith Pet Fragments</li><li>All three Deadlands Scorcher Skin Fragments</li></ul> 
				<p>And of course, coming last in the list but by no means least, Nenuluare the Indrik Vendor will have the following items in stock over the course of the Jubilee:</p> 
				<ul><li>Nascent Indrik Feathers</li><li>Luminous Indrik Berries</li><li>Icebreath Indrik Berries</li><li>Shimmering Indrik pet</li><li>Rimedusk Indrik pet</li></ul>

				<h2>Getting Started</h2> 
				<p>You can access the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> DLC via ESO Plus membership or by purchasing it from the Crown Store for 1,500 crowns (listed under DLC). If your ESO Plus membership lapses, you will lose access to the DLC until you renew your membership or purchase it with crowns. However, you will not lose any items, Achievements, or other rewards earned prior. </p> 
				<p>The <i>Scions of Ithelia </i>Deluxe Bundle is also available for 4,000 crowns and includes access to the DLC game pack, Ashbone Sabre Cat mount, Ashbone Echalette pet, and five Crown Experience Scrolls. You can purchase the Deluxe Bundle from the Featured section of the in-game Crown Store. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/dcf04ee0cbc67f136922edb9f4c415ee.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center"><i>Scions of Ithelia Deluxe Bundle</i></p> <p>Note that ALL ESO Plus members can claim the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> Deluxe Bundle for <b>free during a two-week window </b>starting on each specific platform's launch (March 11 for PC/Mac and March 26 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles)—don't forget to claim it from the Crown Store while it's available!</p> <p>Once you have access to the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> dungeons, you can start both PvE challenges by the following methods: </p> <ul><li>By teleporting directly into the two dungeons from your map</li><li>By using the Dungeon Finder tool</li><li>By walking up to the dungeon entrances within the Reach (Oathsworn Pit) and Wrothgar (Bedlam Veil) </li></ul> <h2>Update 41 Base-Game Patch</h2> <p>Launching at the same time as the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> DLC, the Update 41 base-game patch is completely free for all current <i>ESO</i> players and includes a series of fixes, additions, and improvements to the game's core experience. </p> <p><b>Stackable Siege Weaponry</b></p> <p>Helping you lighten the inventory load in Cyrodiil with Update 41 is the addition of stackable siege weaponry. With this update, you can stack up to 20 similar siege weapons if they are at maximum health. When you have siege weapons in your quickslots, it will always use the weapon with the lowest health in your inventory. </p> <p><b>New Rewards</b></p> <p>This update also introduces some new Rewards for the Worthy PvP item set rewards. This includes the Oakfather's Retribution light armor set, the Blunted Blades medium armor set, and the Baan Dar's Blessing heavy armor set. These new item sets are sure to help you on Tamriel's myriad battlefields, so keep an eye out for them next time you open your Rewards for the Worthy boxes. </p> <p>Additionally, the Unkindness of Ravens body and face marking is now available by acquiring and using the Runebound Tome: Unkindness of Ravens. You can acquire this tome for 100,000 Tel Var Stones, and it requires 50 Siege of Cyrodiil Merits to use. </p> <p>In tandem with the new PvP sets is an all-new Mythic item you can acquire via the Antiquities system. The Torc of the Last Ayleid King necklace disables all other item set bonuses while increasing your Weapon and Spell Damage, boosting your Health, Magicka, and Stamina Recovery, and reducing your total damage taken by 15%.</p> <p>This update also introduces style pages for the various Class Sets found in the Infinite Archive. Now, style pages for your specific class will drop within the archive, with other style pages also dropping once you've earned every page for your specific class. </p> <p><b>Update to ESO's PC/Mac Min Spec</b></p> <p>Finally, Update 41 also features an update to the game's min spec for PC and Mac. This change ensures a continued level of performance for older systems that can be maintained in newer content as well. Specifically, with Update 41, <i>ESO</i> no longer officially supports the Windows 7 operating system for future compatibility. You will still be able to play on Windows 7 machines but note that there's no guarantee that this will continue to be the case moving forward. </p> <p>These Update 41 features and changes outlined above are just some of the highlights included in this base-game patch. You can see the full list of everything included in Update 41 by visiting our <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/patch-notes">Patch Notes forum</a>.

				<h2>Merry Mayhem Returns!</h2> 
				<p>The Jester's Festival in-game event makes its grand return on March 28 at 10AM EDT and will continue until April 4 at 10AM EDT. During this preposterous party, you can enjoy increases to XP gains while collecting ridiculous rewards after completing event-specific quests.</p> 
				<p>To receive admission to the festivities, head over to the event pavilions located within Ebonheart, Vulkhel Guard, or Daggerfall, and speak with one of the three jesters posing as an alliance leader. If you get turned upside-down trying to locate these event sites, open the in-game Crown Store and pick up the Jester's Festival Invitation Quest. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/a841edbe235f95e2366218f317053f4f.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Enjoy frivolous fun!</i> </p> 
				<p>Upon completing the introductory quest, you'll earn the tasty Pie of Misrule memento reward, which can be located within the Mementos section of your Collections. However, unlike previous years, you will no longer need to obtain or use the Pie of Misrule to take advantage of the <b>100% XP buff.</b> This bonus will now be shared passively to all adventurers participating in Tamriel's wackiest holiday. That said, it doesn't make the pie any less scrumptious!</p> 
				<h2>Preposterous Prizes!</h2> 
				<p>Throughout the Jester's Festival, you can pick up various event-specific daily quests. For each one you complete, you'll receive a Jester's Festival Box! Furthermore, the <b>first</b> Jester's Festival daily quest you complete will reward you with one <b>Stupendous Jester's Festival Box</b>.</p> 
				<p>Each of these boxes can include the following items:</p> 
				<ul><li>Festive Dazzlers </li><li>Cherry Blossom Confetti </li><li>Revelry Pies </li><li>Festive furnishings </li><li>Jester's Festival provisioning recipes </li><li>Treasures that can be sold to vendors for Gold</li><li>Previous years' style pages </li><li>One of the following:</li><ul><li>A random unbound page for either the Broom or Bucket styles.</li><li>Regal Regalia or Second Seed style pages</li><li>A fragment for previous Jester's collectibles:</li><ul><li>Cadwell's Surprise Box memento </li><li>Sovereign Sow pet</li><li>Playful Prankster's Surprise Box memento</li></ul></ul></ul> 
				<p>In addition to the aforementioned rewards, the Stupendous Jester's Festival Box has a chance to contain the following goodies:</p> 
				<ul><li><b>NEW:</b> Jester's Seeker Suit outfit style page</li><li>Jester's Scintillator Runebox </li><li>Cherry Blossom Branch Runebox </li><li>Cadwell's Kitchen weapon style page </li><li>High value Treasures </li><li>Festive noise maker parts</li><li>Joke Popper fragments</li></ul>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Jester's Seeker Suit style</i></p> 
				<h2>Impresario &amp; Event Tickets!</h2> 
				<p>During the festivities, you can collect three Event Tickets for the first Jester's Festival quest completed each day. Participating in the festivities every day of the event can earn you up to 24 tickets total. </p> 
				<p>Note that the total number of Event Tickets you can carry at one time is capped at 12. Be sure to regularly spend those tickets and not waste any of this precious event currency!</p> 
				<p>Speaking of which, let's take a peek at what goods the Impresario has in stock:</p> 
				<ul><li>All three Molag Bal Illusion Imp pet fragments </li><ul><li>Anchor Chain Fragment</li><li>Dark Anchor Pinion</li><li>Effigy of the Dominator</li></ul><li>All three fragments for the Planemeld's Master body and face markings </li><ul><li>Crematory Ash</li><li>Incandescent Brimstone</li><li>Seething Censer</li></ul><li>Bound fragments for the Jester's Minstrel Daedroth costume </li></ul> 
				<p>The third and final fragment of the Planemeld's Master body and face markings, the Seething Censer, arrives during this period. This is a great time to grab it, along with any other fragments you need to finish the set!</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/e0387d9f83e7db61b25a2ef260a040a3.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Planemeld's Master body and face markings </i></p>

				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/19bea482afa3af81281f3a355864b6e0.jpg" /><p><i>Take a look at the hoard of wondrous rewards you can earn when adventuring within Wrothgar, available via the Orsinium DLC.</i></p> 
				<p>During this month of March 2024, you can unlock a special reward <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/65635">just by logging in</a>—the much-beloved <i>Orsinium</i> DLC. What's more, you can also earn <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/65645">bonus rewards</a> for playing through the DLC this month once you have access, including costumes and a new mount.</p> 
				<p>Featuring the legendary Wrothgar mountains and the eponymous Orc city, <i>Orsinium </i>contains a wealth of content that laid the groundwork for <i>ESO</i>'s Chapter system and proved a favorite of fans and developers alike. While <i>Orsinium</i> itself is a treasure in that regard, you can also find some great treasures during your adventures within it. From special weaponry to iconic looks, <i>Orsinium </i>has something to offer for everyone.</p> 
				<p>Here's some great examples of rewards you can earn when exploring the <i>Orsinium </i>DLC!</p><p><br></p> 
				<p><b>Bear Witness to These Great Costumes </b></p> 
				<p>Showcase both your might and your fashion sense by wearing a helmet fitted with the toothy head of a bear! Three stylish appearances with ursine helmets—the Old Orsinium Sentry, Cavalier of the Sworn Oath, and Trinimac's Penitent Knight costumes—are available by playing through <i>Orsinium</i>. Earn the Hero of Wrothgar achievement and complete the collections of the House of Orsimer Glories to acquire these looks for yourself.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/24eadde9adac67f115ae775325fa8e9b.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Try not to become unbearable with the pride of earning these</i></p> 
				<p><b>Forge Masterpieces </b></p> 
				<p>The Orcs of Wrothgar are widely renowned for their crafts and metalwork. Now you too can master these secrets by earning pages of the motifs that teach their crafting techniques (and unlock their outfit styles)! Three motifs are available—Malacath, Trinimac, and Ancient Orc. Motif pages for the Malacath style are available by completing daily quests to slay Wrothgar world bosses, while pages for Trinimac style are available from completing daily quests to explore Wrothgar delves. Finally, you can find pages for the Ancient Orc style by defeating Wrothgar public dungeon bosses.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/89560f1e24bdbc9f90ef374673492e64.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The crafting secrets of the Orc tribes can be yours</i></p> 
				<p><b>Feast like an Orc King </b></p> 
				<p>Traditional orc chef Orzorga will share the secrets of her cuisine to adventurers who help her with her culinary preparations. Complete her quests to earn new Provisioning recipes, from her Tripe Trifle Pocket to her legendary Smoked Bear Haunch. Such delicacies may require rare ingredients but offer powerful stat boosts to resource pools and recovery for unusually long durations. Those seeking these recipes can find her at the aptly named Orzoga's Kitchen, slightly northeast of the entrance to Morkuldin Forge.</p><p><br></p> 
				<p><b>Become a Maelstrom of Violence </b></p> 
				<p>When traveling through Wrothgar, you can find an entrance to the Oblivion demirealm of Maelstrom—the Maelstrom Arena. Ruled by the Demiprince <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/65615">Fa-Nuit-Hen</a>, the arena is a proving ground for accomplished warriors from across Tamriel and beyond. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/02/75ff9458dee2cc82ae572a47be507ca7.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Great peril can lead to great rewards!</i></p> 
				<p>Should you triumph over its challenges, you'll be awarded the finest of arms and armor, with special ability-altering weapons available to those who make it all the way through the arena's perils. For example, the Maelstrom Destruction Staves (available in Inferno, Lightning, and Ice varieties) boost the damage ticks of the Wall of Elements skill. There are even weekly leaderboards for the finest combatants to brave the arena.</p><p><br></p> 
				<p><b>Collect Powerful Item Sets </b></p> 
				<p><i>Orsinium </i>is also a great source for item sets to round out your build. The Briarheart set has been a staple of damage dealers for a long time, while the Pariah set is well-loved by those seeking durability for PvP combat. You can find both via activities throughout the zone. </p> 
				<p>What's more, crafters can discover stations to make the superb Law of Julianos set, a long-time staple of those using Magicka to heal or harm, in Wrothgar as well. And while those are some of the most popular sets from Wrothgar, they are by no means the only ones!</p><p><br></p> 
				<p>Have you trekked through the mountains of Wrothgar and found some of its many treasures yet? This is far from a complete list of what you can find there. And that's even without the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/65645">extra rewards you can earn this month</a>, so don't forget to log into <i>ESO </i>and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/65635">claim the <i>Orsinium</i> DLC this month</a> and complete achievements to make the most of it all.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
				In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
				Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a target="_blank" href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
				If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
				We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.
