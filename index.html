				<p>The latest 10-Year Anniversary Spotlight comes to you this September as it shines into the hidden corners of Tamriel's dungeons. Get free dungeon DLC from Daily Login Rewards, unlock and claim a free costume and arms pack, and earn Undaunted Keys as you complete daily Endeavors!</p> 
				<h2>DLC Dungeons Delivered Free</h2> 
				<p>Log in for just a few days during September 2024 to unlock free DLC dungeons. Your third login during the month unlocks the Fang Lair dungeon, while your fourth unlocks the Scalecaller Peak dungeon. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Unlock (and survive) Fang Lair</i></p> 
				<p>These exciting dungeons feature unique rewards including item sets, titles, motifs, and more. Challenge the Blackmarrow necromancers or the cult of Peryite to claim them—good luck! </p> 
				<h2>Dress from Success</h2> 
				<p>Of course, the rewards included in the dungeon content itself aren't the only things you can claim. The Anniversary Spotlight also includes additional unlockable rewards. Complete both dungeons to earn the “Fang Lair Vanquisher” and “Scalecaller Peak Vanquisher” achievements and you can acquire the Dungeon Explorer Costume for free by claiming it from the Crown Store between September 3 and September 24. You can also claim the costume if you have the achievements from prior completions of the dungeons.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Earn achievements to unlock free rewards</i></p> 
				<p>The Undaunted are of course eager to get in on any dungeon-delving action, so you can earn rewards by completing Undaunted Pledges as well. If you earn or already have the achievement “Returned Undaunted” for completing 10 Undaunted Pledges bestowed by Maj al-Ragath, you can claim the Thurvokun Arms Pack from the Crown Store completely free during the same period as the costume.</p> 
				<h2>Endeavor Alongside the Undaunted</h2> 
				<p>Of course, one of the things the Undaunted are most known for is their treasure, shared with the worthy who earn their Undaunted Keys. During the month of September, these rewards are easier to earn than ever, with certain thematic Endeavors available during the month awarding Undaunted Keys in addition to the normal seal amount for the day's Endeavors.</p>

				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/08/ac41c359749773197532e468db0d09e4.jpg" /><p><i>Return to the Infinite Archive, receive new visitors with Home Tours, and discover other additions and fixes—all part of the Update 43 base-game patch. </i></p> 
				<p>The Update 43 base-game patch is now live on PC/Mac. This update introduces new features, content, and improvements to <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i>, completely free for all <i>ESO</i> players.</p> 
				<h2>New Features</h2> 
				<p>Those who enjoy delving deep into the Infinite Archive or showing off their latest home builds will appreciate the two big new features included in Update 43. </p> 
				<p><b>Infinite Archive Update</b></p> 
				<p>Return to the twisting halls of the Infinite Archive (<i>ESO</i>'s near-endless PvE arena) and you'll discover two new unique areas, new monsters, a host of new Visions and Verses, and new rewards. These rewards include new collectibles and seven all-new class sets, not found anywhere else in Tamriel! </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/08/80ebe975c599f3401b74f0d6a176f86a.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Discover new challenges and rewards in the Archive</i></p> 
				<p>To learn more about the additions coming to the Infinite Archive, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66519">this preview blog</a>. </p> 
				<p><b>Home Tours</b></p> 
				<p>Share and showcase your flair for interior design and decoration with Home Tours, a new feature added to <i>ESO</i>'s Housing System. With Home Tours, you can search for homes owned and decorated by another player and filter through labels, such as “Cozy” or “Festive.” </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/08/6cc578d8e8c04208c086cff373a71fc1.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Share your homes with the rest of the community</i></p> 
				<p>You can also browse the top player homes in the Recommended tab, recommend those homes to others, and favorite them to return to later. List your own home and see what people think of your creation! </p> 
				<p>To learn more about Home Tours, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66495">this preview blog</a>. </p> 
				<h2>Additional Improvements</h2> 
				<p>Update 43 also introduces a host of quality-of-life improvements for all <i>ESO</i> players. This includes six new skill styles (for the Silver Bolts, Roar, Twin Slashes, Momentum, Elemental Storm, and Annulment skills) that can have their fragments dropped from base-game activities or acquired with Archival Fortunes from Infinite Archive. </p> 
				<p>In addition, item set curation expands to include monster sets acquired via Undaunted Keys (from the Undaunted vendors), weekly Trial coffers, Trial leaderboard coffers, and Imperial City monster mask coffers. Finally, this update also adds improvements to mount previews within the Crown Store, and both Guild Trader and Guild Bank interfaces now remember the last Guild you interacted with. </p> 
				<p>For a full list of all the changes, new features, and improvements arriving as part of the Update 43 base-game patch, check out the patch notes on <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/patch-notes">the official <i>ESO </i>forums</a>. </p> 
				<h2>Free for All</h2> 
				<p>As a base-game patch, Update 43 is free for all current <i>ESO</i> players—no additional purchases required! Are you excited to share and showcase your home to the rest of <i>ESO</i>'s housing community? Or perhaps you're eager to conquer the Infinite Archive's new stages and claim its new rewards?

				<h2>Mayhem Is On the Rise</h2> 
				<p>The Whitestrake's Mayhem event makes its grand return to Tamriel next Thursday, July 25 at 10AM EDT, and runs until August 6 at 10AM EDT. Throughout the event, you will benefit from a 100% bonus to Alliance Point, XP, and Tel Var Stone gain. In addition, you can earn unique goodies by participating in <i>ESO</i>'s PvP game modes.</p> 
				<p>Ready to clash against other adventurers on the battlefield? Simply follow the steps below:</p> 
				<ol><li>Head over to the in-game Crown Store and receive the “Details on the Whitestrake's Mayhem" quest</li><li>Travel to your Alliance War faction's main gate in Cyrodiil using the Alliance War menu or a Battlegrounds camp outside major cities</li><ol><li>You do not need to travel to Cyrodiil to start the event</li></ol><li>Locate the NPC named “Predicant Maera" and continue the quest</li><ol><li>Note that if you've previously completed the quest, you won't need to do it again</li></ol><li>Complete the quest to receive a complimentary Pelinal's Boon Box</li></ol>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/07/dcf9721d1b9361d959ce7db76d5c1dcc.jpg" />
				<p>One key difference from previous years' events is that you no longer need to obtain or use the Scroll of Pelinal's Ferocity to benefit from the 100% buff to Alliance Point, XP, and Tel Var Stone gains. These bonuses are now shared passively to adventurers skirmishing throughout Cyrodiil, the Imperial City, and Battlegrounds. As a result, there is no longer a method to pick up the Scroll of Pelinal's Ferocity anywhere in-game, and those who already own the item will now notice it no longer offers any functionality.</p> 
				<h2>Battle for Bonus Rewards</h2> 
				<p>While participating in the Whitestrake's Mayhem in-game event, you can amass a collection of bonus in-game goodies for your heroic efforts. </p> 
				<p><b>NEW—Ayleid Lich Outfit Style Armor</b></p> 
				<p>Dominate both the living and the dead while donning the Ayleid Lich Armor, dropped in Pelinal's Boon Boxes.</p> 
				<p><b>Pelinal's Boon Boxes</b></p> 
				<p>You can earn Pelinal's Boon Boxes as rewards from the following activities throughout the event:</p> 
				<ul><li>Battlegrounds quests from Battlemaster Rivyn</li><li>Scouting, Battle, Warfront, and Conquest Missions</li><li>Elder Scroll capture and recapture quests</li><li>Town quests in Vlastarus, Bruma, Cropsford, Cheydinhal, and Chorrol</li><li>Imperial City daily quests</li></ul> 
				<p>Whenever you open a Pelinal's Boon Box, you have the chance to receive the following items:</p> 
				<ul><li>Parcel of Tel Var Stones</li><li>Cyrodiil repair kit</li><li>Soul Gems</li><li><b>ONE</b> of the following:</li><ul><li>Alchemy Ingredients </li><li>Style item for your Alliance's armor style </li><li>Style item for Akaviri armor style </li><li>Daedric siege weapon </li><li>Whitestrake's Mayhem book furnishing</li><li>Forward Camp for your Alliance</li><li>Chapter of your Alliance's armor motif</li><ul><li>There is a small chance that the full book may drop instead of a single chapter</li></ul><li>Prismatic Runestone </li><li>Chapter for the Akaviri armor motif</li><ul><li>There is a small chance that the full book may drop instead of a single chapter</li></ul><li>Small chance to receive one or two fragments of the Alliance Breton Terrier pet</li></ul><li>Small chance to receive a Transmute Geode</li><li>Very small chance to receive an unbound, tradeable Ayleid Lich Armor Style Page</li><ul><li>A Dovah's Du'ul Style Page may drop instead if you've already earned the Ayleid Lich Armor Style Page</li></ul></ul>

				<p>Throughout the celebration, The Golden will not offer Monster Masks and all purchases in her shop will require Alliance Points. Contrary to her title, she will <b>not</b> accept gold.</p> 
				<h2>The Impresario &amp; Event Tickets</h2> 
				<p>During Whitestrake's Mayhem, up to three Event Tickets can be earned each day by completing the following activities:</p> 
				<ul><li>Two Event Tickets from the first Cyrodiil or Battlegrounds daily quest </li><ul><li>This includes Bounty Board quests, a Town Daily, the Conquest Board quests, or the daily Battlegrounds quest</li></ul><li>One Event Ticket from an Imperial City District daily quest</li></ul> 
				<p>You can obtain a total of <b>39</b> Event Tickets by the event's end. Remember: you can only hold up to 12 Event Tickets at one time. Be sure to stop by the Impresario's market now and again to clear the way to collect more Tickets!</p>

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Hi all. We're gathering some feedback regarding the Environmental Sustainability Features added in U42. Specifically, we would like feedback on the following patch note:
				<ul><li>Reduced GPU use in Contextual Menus (Xbox Series X|S and PS5): When viewing most menus, (eg. managing inventory, achievements, quest journal, etc) framerate is now capped to 30fps. Some menus are exempt on a case-by-case basis (eg. conversations, various mini-games). Testing in Performance Mode while in these menus shows a 50% reduction in GPU consumption, resulting in overall power consumption going from approximately 63% of the maximum possible on a console down to 37%.</li>
				</ul>
				We're seeing your feedback about menus capped to 30fps is causing issues for some of you. Please let us know how it is impacting your play experience. We are sharing this with our teams to better inform them of your feedback and how we can improve the experience overall. Additionally, if you are experiencing other framerate issues with either your menus or player character, please note those here as well. Thanks, all.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
				In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
				Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a target="_blank" href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
				If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
				We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Hello everyone! After plenty of testing <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/discussion/632782/new-eso-launcher-testing-and-launch-plan-pc-and-mac">during the last PTS period</a>, we are pleased to announce the rollout of our new patcher on the live servers for PC/Mac. The rollout of the new patcher will happen in four phases, with new countries being added during each phase. As we give countries access to the new patcher, we will make note of it in the list below by noting next to the country name (has the new patcher.) We will also note what phase we are currently in by specifying whether it has not started, in progress, or complete, next to the phase number. The countries getting the patcher are listed in order below.<br><br>
				Thanks for your patience as we roll this out to all countries listed below. A special thanks to everyone who helped test out the launcher during the last PTS and provided feedback.<br><br>
				Edit for 3/4/2024: All phases have now been complete.<br><br><b>Phase 1 (Complete) </b>

				<ul><li>Some Czech Republic players may not have their country recognized, thus making them unable to upgrade the patch at this time. We are aware of the issue and working toward a solution.</li>
				<li>Audio issues with sound volume and sound effects. We have a bug in for this and are working on a fix for the future.</li>
