				<p>The Fallen Leaves of West Weald in-game event kicks off on Thursday, September 26 at 10AM EDT and continues until Tuesday, October 8. During the event, you can seek out lost relics of the ancient Ayleid empire, learn about the history surrounding Cyrodiil's ancient rulers, and unlock collectible rewards for ALL <i>Gold Road</i> Chapter owners. </p> 
				<h2>Seek Lost Knowledge, Together!</h2> 
				<p>Throughout the event period, you can acquire the new daily quest, “Fallen Leaves of West Weald,” available from Gandrinar, located outside the Skingrad Impresario's tent. To complete this new daily, collect lost Ayleid relics, bundle them, and bring them back to Gandrinar. Doing so will grant event quest rewards (and on occasion, some additional lore about the region's ancient rulers), in addition to progressing the Fallen Leaves of West Weald meter, found on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/fallenleaves">event's official page</a>. </p> 
				<p>As the community completes the new daily quest, they help progress a new event meter, unlocking three tiers of rewards:</p> 
				<ul><li>33%—Vineyard Voriplasm pet</li><li>66% —Luminescing Varla Stone memento</li><li>100%—Russet Brekka mount, Tree-Sap Legion arms pack, and a nesting rewards box </li></ul>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/09/3c1a54c350bddc00784efdb8f3d12c41.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Unlock these event rewards</i></p> 
				<p>When the event ends on October 8 (or as soon the meter reaches 100%), the community can claim all unlocked rewards free from the in-game Crown Store for a limited time. Note that these rewards can be unlocked and claimed ONLY by <i>Gold Road</i> Chapter players, so if you've yet to own <i>ESO</i>'s latest adventure, be sure to pick it up. </p> 
				<p>Be sure to visit the official <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/fallenleaves">Fallen Leaves of West Weald page</a> often to check the community's progress and see what rewards have been unlocked. </p>

				<p>You can obtain regular Undaunted Reward Boxes by completing Bolgrul's Daily Undaunted Delve quest. You can locate Bolgrul within any Undaunted Enclave. </p>

				<p>The Undaunted are of course eager to get in on any dungeon-delving action, so you can earn rewards by completing Undaunted Pledges as well. If you earn or already have the achievement “Returned Undaunted” for completing 10 Undaunted Pledges bestowed by Maj al-Ragath, you can claim the Thurvokun Arms Pack from the Crown Store completely free during the same period as the costume.</p> 
				<h2>Endeavor Alongside the Undaunted</h2> 
				<p>Of course, one of the things the Undaunted are most known for is their treasure, shared with the worthy who earn their Undaunted Keys. During the month of September, these rewards are easier to earn than ever, with certain thematic Endeavors available during the month awarding Undaunted Keys in addition to the normal seal amount for the day's Endeavors.</p>

			<div class="modal-body">
				Hi all. We're gathering some feedback regarding the Environmental Sustainability Features added in U42. Specifically, we would like feedback on the following patch note:
				<ul><li>Reduced GPU use in Contextual Menus (Xbox Series X|S and PS5): When viewing most menus, (eg. managing inventory, achievements, quest journal, etc) framerate is now capped to 30fps. Some menus are exempt on a case-by-case basis (eg. conversations, various mini-games). Testing in Performance Mode while in these menus shows a 50% reduction in GPU consumption, resulting in overall power consumption going from approximately 63% of the maximum possible on a console down to 37%.</li>
				</ul>
				We're seeing your feedback about menus capped to 30fps is causing issues for some of you. Please let us know how it is impacting your play experience. We are sharing this with our teams to better inform them of your feedback and how we can improve the experience overall. Additionally, if you are experiencing other framerate issues with either your menus or player character, please note those here as well. Thanks, all.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
				In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
				Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a target="_blank" href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
				If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
				We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Hello everyone! After plenty of testing <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/discussion/632782/new-eso-launcher-testing-and-launch-plan-pc-and-mac">during the last PTS period</a>, we are pleased to announce the rollout of our new patcher on the live servers for PC/Mac. The rollout of the new patcher will happen in four phases, with new countries being added during each phase. As we give countries access to the new patcher, we will make note of it in the list below by noting next to the country name (has the new patcher.) We will also note what phase we are currently in by specifying whether it has not started, in progress, or complete, next to the phase number. The countries getting the patcher are listed in order below.<br><br>
				Thanks for your patience as we roll this out to all countries listed below. A special thanks to everyone who helped test out the launcher during the last PTS and provided feedback.<br><br>
				Edit for 3/4/2024: All phases have now been complete.<br><br><b>Phase 1 (Complete) </b>

				<ul><li>Some Czech Republic players may not have their country recognized, thus making them unable to upgrade the patch at this time. We are aware of the issue and working toward a solution.</li>
				<li>Audio issues with sound volume and sound effects. We have a bug in for this and are working on a fix for the future.</li>
