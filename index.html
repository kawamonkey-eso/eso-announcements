				<p><i>The cat's eyes seem to speak, saying, "Jolly good to see you! We appear to have a small blight of rodents. Dreadful crawling things. Scuttling everywhere. Hmm, skittering blights. I knew a good joke about that. What? Oh, yes. Lovely day for a hunt!"</i></p>

			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/2986fc33560b70052ac679f2b54a8ffb.jpg" /><p><i>It's ESO's 10<sup>th</sup> birthday and everybody is invited! Find out how to join in the fun as we celebrate 10 years together.</i></p> 
				<h2>ESO Turns Ten!</h2> 
				<p>To celebrate this huge new milestone, the Anniversary Jubilee in-game event is back and better than ever. Kicking off on <b>April 4 at 10AM EDT</b>, the event will continue until <b>April 23 at 10AM EDT</b> as part of a special extended stay. Even better, the +100% XP buff once gained by eating slices of cake is now active throughout the whole event, with no risk of losing the benefits due to ongoing battle or a full stomach.</p> 
				<p>To get started, complete the quest “For Cake's Sake” to earn this year's Jubilee Cake, available from the young Khajiit chef Apprentice Mogh near the docks of Vulkhel Guard, Davon's Watch, and Daggerfall, or found free in Quest Starters section of the in-game Crown Store.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/66fcdf167b0a947d5c0e40ab9429a0d2.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Help Mogh bake a treat</i></p> 
				<p>Once you've acquired the 2024 Jubilee Cake memento, you can earn <b>three event tickets each day</b> by simply using your cake and enjoying a delicious slice. Combine that with this event's special length, and you can earn up to <b>60 event tickets total</b>! </p> 
				<p>And as a reminder, unlike previous years, using the cake is not necessary to keep the +100% XP buff from the event active. Still, don't forget to enjoy a slice of cake every day to get your tickets, and try not to let them get stuck between your teeth!</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/d788eef7d81d058b428388399110172b.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>A new year means a new cake!</i></p> 
				<h2>Big Birthday Boons</h2> 
				<p>The Jubilee Cake isn't the only thing seeing improvements this year. The traditional Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes are changing too. You can now earn Gift Boxes from additional sources, and the first Gift Box you earn from any source each day will be a gold <b>Glorious Anniversary Jubilee Gift Box</b> with incredible rewards. Additional reward boxes will be regular <b>Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes</b>, but don't let that concern you—these boxes give rewards of similar quality to the gold boxes of years past.</p> 
				<p>You can earn Gift Boxes from any of the following sources (bear in mind that only the first Gift Box earned each day will be a Glorious box, no matter where you get it):</p> 
				<ul><li>Any daily quest in the game, as in previous years, including:</li><ul><li>Daily crafting writs</li><li>Daily Delve, World Boss, and Incursion event quests</li><li>Daily Alliance War and Battlegrounds quests</li><li>Daily Dungeon and Trial quests</li><li>Daily Heist and Sacrament quests</li></ul><li>Killing and looting any final Dungeon boss</li><li>Killing and looting any final Trial boss</li><li>Killing and looting any World boss</li><li>Completing any Incursion event, such as a Dark Anchor, Abyssal Geyser, Bastion Nymic, or similar</li><li>Rewards for the Worthy reward mails (the box will appear inside the parcel received)</li><li>A chance from Tales of Tribute reward mails, with a higher chance to receive one based on the challenge of the opponent or the number of opponents face during a daily (the box will appear inside the parcel received)</li></ul> 
				<p>What's in these wonderful boxes, you might ask? In the case of the Glorious Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes available once daily, they contain:</p> 
				<ul><li>Crafting materials</li><li>A motif chapter, furnishing recipe, or style item</li><li><b>New:</b> A tradeable outfit style page for the Earthbone Ayleid armor style</li><li><b>New:</b> A fragment for the new Jubilee Steed mount (note that you need 25 total fragments to make the steed, so keep some Event Tickets ready if you want this one!)</li><li>1 to 10 Transmute Crystals</li><li>Desecrated Grave Soil, the Worm Cult style item</li></ul>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/586990e91467d6e178522d0d85771a56.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>2024 Anniversary Jubilee rewards</i></p> 
				<p>Subsequent boxes earned in a day are Anniversary Jubilee Gift Boxes and contain:</p> 
				<ul><li>Crafting materials</li><li>A small chance for a motif chapter, furnishing recipe, or style item</li><li>A chance for 1 to 10 Transmute Crystals</li><li>A chance for Desecrated Grave Soil, the Worm Cult style item</li><li>A small chance for a tradeable style page for last year's Bonemold armor style</li><li>Another small chance for a tradeable style page from any of the Bonemold, Saberkeel, or Worm Cult outfit styles</li></ul> 
				<p>That's a treasure trove of rewards in every box, and playing <i>ESO </i>throughout the event can earn you a great many boxes. But that's not all!</p> 
				<p>In addition to the Gift Boxes and the rewards therein, you can also earn new cosmetic rewards that have never before been earnable in game, although they may be familiar to some players.</p> 
				<ul><li>As an extremely small chance from any fishing node during the Jubilee, you may find outfit style pages for the Trueflame Sword Replica. Yes, really!</li><li>Any Dolmen reward chest has a chance to contain a style page for the Staff of Worms Replica, in recognition (though not honor) of Mannimarco's dark deeds.</li><li>Any World Boss in Vvardenfell has a chance to drop a style page for either the Sunna'rah Replica or the Barbas Helmet Replica, as seen during that Chapter's story.</li><li>Any Geyser in Summerset has a chance to drop a style page for the Ul'vor Staff, as seen during that Chapter's story.</li></ul> 
				<h2>Event Tickets and Vendors</h2> 
				<p>When you've got as many Event Tickets as the Jubilee will award, you need things to spend them on. Fortunately, the Impresario came prepared with an extensive stock for her stall. In preparation for this year's festivities, she has filled her inventory with the following items:</p> 
				<ul><li>All three Molag Bal Illusion Imp pet fragments</li><ul><li>Anchor Chain Fragment</li><li>Dark Anchor Pinion</li><li>Effigy of the Dominator</li></ul><li>The first two fragments for the <b>new </b>Master of Schemes personality</li><ul><li>Cold Iron Gauntlet</li><li>Grim Iron Mask</li></ul><li>Bound style pages for the Earthbone Ayleid armor style</li><li>Anniversary Cake furnishings (note that these require you to own the respective year's cake memento to buy!)</li><li>Anniversary Cake Slice furnishings (unlike the full cakes, you do not need to own the respective year's cake memento to buy these!)</li><li>Jubilee Steed mount fragments</li><li>Bags of Jubilee Yesteryear, containing the following, providing only items you do not currently own:</li><ul><li>Bound Worm Cult motif chapters </li><li>Jephrine Paladin armor style pages</li><li>Imperial Champion weapon style pages</li><li>Prophet armor style pages</li><li>Lyris armor style pages</li><li>Sai Sahan armor style pages</li><li>Abnur Tharn armor style pages</li><li>Bound Saberkeel armor style pages</li><li>Bound Bonemold armor style pages</li><li>Aurora Firepot Spider parts (excluding the instructions, which are available from the Impresario's assistant, Philius Dormier)</li><li>Desecrated Grave Soil (note that this is a chance in addition to whatever else the bag contains)</li></ul><li>Group Repair Kits</li><li>Companion Guild Commendations</li></ul>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/0fe7e2881b27f875fd5955e6a61a4b01.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Master of Schemes personality</i></p> 
				<p>All that inventory makes the Impresario quite well-stocked indeed! But what about her assistant, Philius Dormier? In addition to his usual wares, he will be stocking:</p> 
				<ul><li>All three Unstable Morpholith Pet Fragments</li><li>All three Deadlands Scorcher Skin Fragments</li></ul> 
				<p>And of course, coming last in the list but by no means least, Nenuluare the Indrik Vendor will have the following items in stock over the course of the Jubilee:</p> 
				<ul><li>Nascent Indrik Feathers</li><li>Luminous Indrik Berries</li><li>Icebreath Indrik Berries</li><li>Shimmering Indrik pet</li><li>Rimedusk Indrik pet</li></ul>

			<div class="modal-body">
				Hi everyone,<br><br>
				In an effort to collate issues discovered after today's launch of Update 41, below is a list of notable known issues and their current status. We'll make a note in the subject when we make any edits or updates.<br><br><ul><li><span style="color:red"><i>UPDATED!</i></span> <b>Achievement progress appears to be reset</b>
				<ul><li>STATUS: Hotfix complete</li>
				<li>Note that achievement progress is not <i>actually</i> being lost and this is just a display issue. You are free to continue earning progress toward achievements without fear of your progress being lost.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li><span style="color:red"><i>UPDATED!</i></span> <b>Outfit slots are being reset</b>
				<ul><li>STATUS: Hotfix complete</li>
				<li>We have deployed a hotfix for this issue. As of the March 13th hotfix, your Outfit Style slots will no longer reset when you rezone while your character is dead. However, if you rezone while your character is dead, any Outfit Styles will be erroneously categorized under "Unavailable". This is a visual issue and you can still use any earned Outfit Styles; reloading the UI will fix this issue until we roll out a full fix for this. We will keep you posted on next steps for any lost Outfit Style presets.</li>
				<li>We have provided additional information regarding outfit change tokens and experience scrolls that will be granted during the March 25th incremental. For the full write up, please follow the link <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/654462/update-on-outfit-resetting-march-14-2024">here</a>.</li>
				<li>Follow up on the issue where the outfit tokens were not granted on March 25. We have resolved the issue and they will be granted on April 8. For more information, please follow the link <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/comment/8075827/#Comment_8075827">here</a>. Thanks!</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li><span style="color:red"><i>UPDATED!</i></span> <b>Cannot set online/offline status</b>
				<ul><li>STATUS: Fixed in March 25 Incremental</li>
				<li>WORKAROUND: You can swap to Gamepad Mode to set your online/offline status, or click a few pixels below the dropdown arrow to access the menu</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li><b>UI fonts are difficult to read</b>
				<ul><li>STATUS: Investigating</li>
				<li>While we did make changes to the UI font rendering in Update 41, we are tracking situations where the UI is too difficult to read and improvements can be made</li>
				<li>POTENTIAL WORKAROUNDS:
				<ul><li>Please ensure addons are either disabled or updated</li>
				<li>Update your resolution if you can do so</li>
				<li>Increase your Chat Window Font Size (Settings&gt;Social&gt;Chat Settings&gt;Text Size) or Interface Scale (Settings&gt;Video&gt;Interface&gt;Use Custom Scale)</li>
				</ul></li>
				</ul></li>
				<li><span style="color:red"><i>UPDATED!</i></span><b>Old Rewards for the Worthy granting two item sets</b>
				<ul><li>STATUS: Fixed in March 25 Incremental. Fix incorporated for console launch.</li>
				<li>You are free to open any Rewards of the Worthy containers – those earned before we launched Update 41 or current – and claim the items without any worry of being actioned</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li><b>Game is locking up or freezing after logging in</b>
				<ul><li>STATUS: Investigating</li>

				<li><b>Not all siege weaponry is stacking together</b>

				<p><b>Oathsworn Pit</b></p> 
				<p>A training ground for Malacath's most-devoted followers has been invaded, and the God of Curses calls upon you to enact his revenge!

				<h2>Getting Started</h2> 
				<p>You can access the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> DLC via ESO Plus membership or by purchasing it from the Crown Store for 1,500 crowns (listed under DLC). If your ESO Plus membership lapses, you will lose access to the DLC until you renew your membership or purchase it with crowns. However, you will not lose any items, Achievements, or other rewards earned prior. </p> 
				<p>The <i>Scions of Ithelia </i>Deluxe Bundle is also available for 4,000 crowns and includes access to the DLC game pack, Ashbone Sabre Cat mount, Ashbone Echalette pet, and five Crown Experience Scrolls. You can purchase the Deluxe Bundle from the Featured section of the in-game Crown Store. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/03/dcf04ee0cbc67f136922edb9f4c415ee.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center"><i>Scions of Ithelia Deluxe Bundle</i></p> <p>Note that ALL ESO Plus members can claim the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> Deluxe Bundle for <b>free during a two-week window </b>starting on each specific platform's launch (March 11 for PC/Mac and March 26 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles)—don't forget to claim it from the Crown Store while it's available!</p> <p>Once you have access to the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> dungeons, you can start both PvE challenges by the following methods: </p> <ul><li>By teleporting directly into the two dungeons from your map</li><li>By using the Dungeon Finder tool</li><li>By walking up to the dungeon entrances within the Reach (Oathsworn Pit) and Wrothgar (Bedlam Veil) </li></ul> <h2>Update 41 Base-Game Patch</h2> <p>Launching at the same time as the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> DLC, the Update 41 base-game patch is completely free for all current <i>ESO</i> players and includes a series of fixes, additions, and improvements to the game's core experience. </p> <p><b>Stackable Siege Weaponry</b></p> <p>Helping you lighten the inventory load in Cyrodiil with Update 41 is the addition of stackable siege weaponry. With this update, you can stack up to 20 similar siege weapons if they are at maximum health. When you have siege weapons in your quickslots, it will always use the weapon with the lowest health in your inventory. </p> <p><b>New Rewards</b></p> <p>This update also introduces some new Rewards for the Worthy PvP item set rewards. This includes the Oakfather's Retribution light armor set, the Blunted Blades medium armor set, and the Baan Dar's Blessing heavy armor set. These new item sets are sure to help you on Tamriel's myriad battlefields, so keep an eye out for them next time you open your Rewards for the Worthy boxes. </p> <p>Additionally, the Unkindness of Ravens body and face marking is now available by acquiring and using the Runebound Tome: Unkindness of Ravens. You can acquire this tome for 100,000 Tel Var Stones, and it requires 50 Siege of Cyrodiil Merits to use. </p> <p>In tandem with the new PvP sets is an all-new Mythic item you can acquire via the Antiquities system. The Torc of the Last Ayleid King necklace disables all other item set bonuses while increasing your Weapon and Spell Damage, boosting your Health, Magicka, and Stamina Recovery, and reducing your total damage taken by 15%.</p> <p>This update also introduces style pages for the various Class Sets found in the Infinite Archive. Now, style pages for your specific class will drop within the archive, with other style pages also dropping once you've earned every page for your specific class. </p> <p><b>Update to ESO's PC/Mac Min Spec</b></p> <p>Finally, Update 41 also features an update to the game's min spec for PC and Mac. This change ensures a continued level of performance for older systems that can be maintained in newer content as well. Specifically, with Update 41, <i>ESO</i> no longer officially supports the Windows 7 operating system for future compatibility. You will still be able to play on Windows 7 machines but note that there's no guarantee that this will continue to be the case moving forward. </p> <p>These Update 41 features and changes outlined above are just some of the highlights included in this base-game patch. You can see the full list of everything included in Update 41 by visiting our <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/patch-notes">Patch Notes forum</a>.

				<p>To receive admission to the festivities, head over to the event pavilions located within Ebonheart, Vulkhel Guard, or Daggerfall, and speak with one of the three jesters posing as an alliance leader. If you get turned upside-down trying to locate these event sites, open the in-game Crown Store and pick up the Jester's Festival Invitation Quest. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Enjoy frivolous fun!</i> </p> 
				<p>Upon completing the introductory quest, you'll earn the tasty Pie of Misrule memento reward, which can be located within the Mementos section of your Collections. However, unlike previous years, you will no longer need to obtain or use the Pie of Misrule to take advantage of the <b>100% XP buff.</b> This bonus will now be shared passively to all adventurers participating in Tamriel's wackiest holiday. That said, it doesn't make the pie any less scrumptious!</p> 
				<h2>Preposterous Prizes!</h2>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Jester's Seeker Suit style</i></p> 
				<h2>Impresario &amp; Event Tickets!</h2>

			<div class="modal-body">
				On March 13, we deployed a hotfix to resolve outfits from resetting. Players should feel free to reapply outfits as they like. For those impacted by the outfit resetting issue, we are granting the following during our March 25 incremental:
				<ul><li>Anyone who had outfits reset will be granted two outfit change tokens per slot affected. So for example if you had three outfits reset, you will be granted six outfit change tokens.</li>
				<li>Additionally for time lost having to reset outfits, we will grant five 150% experience scrolls.</li>
				</ul>
				When these items are granted on March 25, you will receive the experience scrolls via in-game mail, while the outfit change tokens are added directly to your account. We've identified impacted players through our logs, so you do not need to submit a ticket to receive the granted items. Lastly, this issue has been identified and will be resolved for console launch.<br><br>
				Thanks again for flagging this issue and working with us to come to a resolution for everyone impacted.

Motif pages for the Malacath style are available by completing daily quests to slay Wrothgar world bosses, while pages for Trinimac style are available from completing daily quests to explore Wrothgar delves.

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The crafting secrets of the Orc tribes can be yours</i></p> 
				<p><b>Feast like an Orc King </b></p> 
				<p>Traditional orc chef Orzorga will share the secrets of her cuisine to adventurers who help her with her culinary preparations. Complete her quests to earn new Provisioning recipes, from her Tripe Trifle Pocket to her legendary Smoked Bear Haunch. Such delicacies may require rare ingredients but offer powerful stat boosts to resource pools and recovery for unusually long durations. Those seeking these recipes can find her at the aptly named Orzoga's Kitchen, slightly northeast of the entrance to Morkuldin Forge.</p><p><br></p> 
				<p><b>Become a Maelstrom of Violence </b></p> 
				<p>When traveling through Wrothgar, you can find an entrance to the Oblivion demirealm of Maelstrom—the Maelstrom Arena. Ruled by the Demiprince <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/65615">Fa-Nuit-Hen</a>, the arena is a proving ground for accomplished warriors from across Tamriel and beyond. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Great peril can lead to great rewards!</i></p> 
				<p>Should you triumph over its challenges, you'll be awarded the finest of arms and armor, with special ability-altering weapons available to those who make it all the way through the arena's perils. For example, the Maelstrom Destruction Staves (available in Inferno, Lightning, and Ice varieties) boost the damage ticks of the Wall of Elements skill. There are even weekly leaderboards for the finest combatants to brave the arena.</p><p><br></p> 
				<p><b>Collect Powerful Item Sets </b></p> 
				<p><i>Orsinium </i>is also a great source for item sets to round out your build. The Briarheart set has been a staple of damage dealers for a long time, while the Pariah set is well-loved by those seeking durability for PvP combat. You can find both via activities throughout the zone. </p> 
				<p>What's more, crafters can discover stations to make the superb Law of Julianos set, a long-time staple of those using Magicka to heal or harm, in Wrothgar as well. And while those are some of the most popular sets from Wrothgar, they are by no means the only ones!</p><p><br></p> 
				<p>Have you trekked through the mountains of Wrothgar and found some of its many treasures yet? This is far from a complete list of what you can find there. And that's even without the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/65645">extra rewards you can earn this month</a>, so don't forget to log into <i>ESO </i>and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/65635">claim the <i>Orsinium</i> DLC this month</a> and complete achievements to make the most of it all.

				<h2>Mayhem Returns to Tamriel</h2> 
				<p>The Whitestrake's Mayhem returns to Tamriel this Thursday, February 22 at 10AM EST, and runs until March 5 at 10AM EST. Throughout this event, you will enjoy boosts to Alliance Point, XP, and Tel Var Stone gains in addition to earning unique in-game rewards by participating in <i>ESO</i>'s various PvP modes.</p> 
				<p>Ready to go toe-to-toe with your fellow players? Follow these steps below:</p> 
				<ol><li>Visit the in-game Crown Store to receive the “Details on the Whitestrake's Mayhem" quest</li><li>Travel to your Alliance War faction's main gate in Cyrodiil using the Alliance War menu or a Battlegrounds camp outside major cities</li><ul><li>You are not required to travel to Cyrodiil to kick off the event</li></ul><li>Find the NPC named “Predicant Maera" and continue the quest</li><ul><li>If you already completed the quest in a previous year, you won't need to do it again</li></ul><li>Complete the quest to receive a complimentary Pelinal's Boon Box</li></ol>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2022/02/4312ec3ee78e93c7412336316faecb91.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Prove your mettle to Predicant Maera</i></p> 
				<p>Unlike previous years, you will no longer need to obtain or use the Scroll of Pelinal's Ferocity to enjoy the 100% buff to Alliance Point, XP, and Tel Var Stone gains. These bonuses will now be shared passively to adventurers competing throughout Cyrodiil, the Imperial City, and Battlegrounds. </p> 
				<p>Now that the Scroll of Pelinal's Ferocity isn't required to enjoy these boons, there will be no way to pick up the Scroll anywhere in-game, and those who already own the item will notice it no longer serves any function.</p> 
				<h2>Seize Special Rewards </h2> 
				<p>By participating in the Whitestrake's Mayhem in-game event, you can earn a host of unique in-game rewards. </p> 
				<p><b>NEW—Dovah's Du'ul Armor Style</b></p> 
				<p>Intimidate your rivals by donning the imposing Dovah's Du'ul armor style, dropped in Pelinal Boon Boxes.</p>

				<p>Keep in mind that the Golden will not sell monster masks during Whitestrake's Mayhem and all purchases in her shop must be made with Alliance Points. Despite her name, she will <b>not</b> accept gold.</p> 
				<h2>The Impresario &amp; Event Tickets</h2> 
				<p>You can earn up to three Event Tickets each day by completing the following two PvP activities:</p>

				In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
				Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a target="_blank" href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
				If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
				We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.

				Hello everyone! After plenty of testing <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/discussion/632782/new-eso-launcher-testing-and-launch-plan-pc-and-mac">during the last PTS period</a>, we are pleased to announce the rollout of our new patcher on the live servers for PC/Mac. The rollout of the new patcher will happen in four phases, with new countries being added during each phase. As we give countries access to the new patcher, we will make note of it in the list below by noting next to the country name (has the new patcher.) We will also note what phase we are currently in by specifying whether it has not started, in progress, or complete, next to the phase number. The countries getting the patcher are listed in order below.<br><br>
				Thanks for your patience as we roll this out to all countries listed below. A special thanks to everyone who helped test out the launcher during the last PTS and provided feedback.<br><br>
				Edit for 3/4/2024: All phases have now been complete.<br><br><b>Phase 1 (Complete) </b>
				<ol><li>Netherlands (Has the new patcher)</li>
				<li>Sweden (Has the new patcher)</li>
				<li>Czech Republic/ Finland (Has the new patcher)</li>
				<li>Norway/ Denmark (Has the new patcher)</li>
				<li>Hungary/ Switzerland/ Romania (Has the new patcher)</li>
				</ol><br><b>Phase 2 (Complete) </b>

				This phase will encompass all other countries where ESO is available, that are not listed above. (All countries where ESO is available now have access to the launcher.)<br><br><b>Known Issues</b>
				<ul><li>Some Czech Republic players may not have their country recognized, thus making them unable to upgrade the patch at this time. We are aware of the issue and working toward a solution.</li>
				<li>Audio issues with sound volume and sound effects. We have a bug in for this and are working on a fix for the future.</li>
