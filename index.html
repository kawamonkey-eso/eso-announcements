				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/07/a485860acb4ef7db7339db29ead9f8ec.jpg" /><p><i>Learn about Home Tours, updates to the Infinite Archive, and more with our sneak peek at Update 43!</i></p> 
				<p>The Update 43 base-game patch is set to bring a ton of great features and improvements to all <i>ESO</i> players,<b> completely free of charge</b>, on August 19 for PC/Mac and September 4 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles. </p> 
				<p>Eager to check it out? You can test out the new update for yourself on the PC/Mac Public Test Server early next week—keep an eye out for the announcement blog! If you missed the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2188253758">preview livestream</a>, or just want more details, check out what's coming below. </p> 
				<h2>Home Tours</h2> 
				<p>One of the year's most anticipated new features for Tamriel's housing enthusiasts is Home Tours, a new entry in the Activity Finder that shares and showcases listed player homes. </p> 
				<p>With Home Tours, you can search for homes owned and decorated by another player you know by searching for their UserID. You can also filter through other criteria like owner-applied labels for theme, such as “Libraries” or “Strongholds.” Of course, the creativity of many players defies such simple categorization, so if you're interested in seeing all sorts of homes or in viewing the most popular creations, you can browse the top player homes in the Recommended tab of Home Tours. Whatever way you search, friends and guildmates will be specially tagged in the feed for easy recognition. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/07/1fb5d9343a4564711c639ddeada956f3.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Tour Tamriel together!</i></p> 
				<p>When you find a home that really impresses you, you can recommend it to others, as well as favorite it for yourself to visit later. You can even favorite homes you visit through other means, regardless of whether they are listed for Home Tours. There's a weekly limit on how many homes you can recommend, but no limit on how many you can visit and enjoy. Your own home may be featured as a recommended home in the Activity Finder if it becomes popular enough! </p> 
				<h2>Infinite Archive Update</h2> 
				<p>Update 43 also adds more depth to the Infinite Archive in the form of new maps, enemies, Verses and Visions, and updated loot, including new class item sets! This includes new hazard stages where the Archive itself presents a danger and a wider pool of foes to battle in maligraphic form. </p> 
				<p>Helping you tackle these new challenges are eight additional Verses and 10 additional Visions. For example, you can use the new Phalanx verse to call on ghostly soldiers to form a wall of defenders, collect the new Necrotic Vision set to unlock an Undead Avatar transformation that allows you to empower yourself with each defeated enemy, and more. You can also earn potent new consumable items that unlock a guaranteed transformation verse like the Undead Avatar, but getting them will not be easy!</p> 
				<p>Once you return to the Index with your hard-won Archival Fortunes, you can spend them on new rewards, whether as part of Filer Ool's rotating stock or purchased from new arrival Filer Brax, who stocks all gear from the class item sets. Filer Brax's inventory isn't limited to the existing seven sets from the Archive's launch, but also includes new sets like the gruesome Corpseburster set for Necromancers that detonates corpses your skills consume. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/64891">As before</a>, each of these sets is themed around a specific class skill line.</p> 
				<h2>Quality of Life Improvements</h2> 
				<p>The above new features and additions aren't the only focus of Update 43. Several smaller improvements included in Update 43 are aimed at making your time in Tamriel easier and more enjoyable. </p> 
				<p>For example, item curation, the system that prevents duplicate item drops within a set while you are still filling it out in Collections, expands to cover new sources. These include weekly Trial rewards, offerings from Imperial City vendors, and the Dungeon-specific reward chests for monster sets available for Undaunted Keys from Glirion the Redbeard, Maj-al Ragath, and Urgarlag Chief-bane at the Undaunted Enclaves. </p> 
				<p>The update also includes improvements to mount previews in the Crown Store, allowing you to preview and replay animations such as summoning or rearing up without needing to purchase a mount. Finally, many further smaller changes and bug fixes are included in Update 43. For example, Guild Trader and Guild Bank interfaces remember the last player Guild you interacted with in a play session.</p> 
				<p>Update 43 brings a host of new features, improvements, and fixes to Tamriel's adventurers, and you can test them out for yourself on PTS next week. Keep an eye out for those patch notes, too!

			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				We are currently investigating an issue that emerged after the Gold Road and Update 42 maintenance on Xbox and PlayStation servers where some players are missing the Jubilee Steed after previously earning it during this year's Anniversary Jubilee event in April. Players who are affected by this will also see their "Jubilee Confetti Conveyor" achievement progress reset to zero. This is occurring on the Xbox and PlayStation servers.<br><br>
				While investigations are ongoing, we will ensure that any players affected by this issue get the Jubilee Steed back. We do not need affected players to submit a Support Ticket at this time. We will follow up here and in <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/660761/jubilee-mount-missing-ps5">this discussion thread</a> as we have more information to share.<br><br>
				Thank you!,Hi everyone! We have identified the issue on Xbox and PlayStation servers and are working on a fix. We plan to push this fix during the next console incremental patch, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, July 10. Here's what you need to know, once the fix is live:
				<ul><li>If you had the Jubilee Steed and completed the "Jubilee Confetti Conveyor" achievement before, you will have the mount back and your achievement will once again be complete.</li>
				<li>If you had <i>partial</i> progress towards the "Jubilee Confetti Conveyor" achievement completion, we will bump you back to where you were before the Update 42 launch on consoles.</li>
				<li>If you use Jubilee Confetti Packs before the fix goes live, you will lose that progress toward the "Jubilee Confetti Conveyor" achievement when it does. We encourage you not to use any additional Jubilee Confetti Packs until after the fix is live on July 10.</li>
				</ul>
				Players affected by this issue do not need to submit a Support Ticket. Thank you all for your patience.

			<div class="modal-body">
				Hi all. We're gathering some feedback regarding the Environmental Sustainability Features added in U42. Specifically, we would like feedback on the following patch note:
				<ul><li>Reduced GPU use in Contextual Menus (Xbox Series X|S and PS5): When viewing most menus, (eg. managing inventory, achievements, quest journal, etc) framerate is now capped to 30fps. Some menus are exempt on a case-by-case basis (eg. conversations, various mini-games). Testing in Performance Mode while in these menus shows a 50% reduction in GPU consumption, resulting in overall power consumption going from approximately 63% of the maximum possible on a console down to 37%.</li>
				</ul>
				We're seeing your feedback about menus capped to 30fps is causing issues for some of you. Please let us know how it is impacting your play experience. We are sharing this with our teams to better inform them of your feedback and how we can improve the experience overall. Additionally, if you are experiencing other framerate issues with either your menus or player character, please note those here as well. Thanks, all.

				<h2>Gold Road Chapter</h2> 
				<p>In <i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road</i> you can venture into the heart of Colovian Imperial culture as you unravel the mystery of the return of a never-before-seen Daedric Prince—Ithelia. While <i>Gold Road</i> continues (and concludes) the Shadow Over Morrowind narrative that began in 2023, you can experience and enjoy the latest Chapter's storyline without having to play any of the game's previous content. </p> 
				<p><b>West Weald Zone</b></p> 
				<p>Located along Cyrodiil's southwest border and neighboring Valenwood and the Gold Coast, this new Chapter allows you to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66003">explore West Weald</a>, a wealthy Imperial province thrown into chaos. Home to the proud and cosmopolitan Colovians, West Weald has found itself besieged by mysterious unknown Daedra. Even worse, a large part of the region has seemingly overnight become overgrown by the vast jungles of Valenwood, resulting in the migration of local Wood Elves. </p>

Discover more about the zone in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66003">this preview blog</a>. </p> 
				<p><b>Scribing System</b></p> 
				<p>An all-new system introduced with <i>Gold Road</i>, Scribing grants you the ability to craft and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66057">customize your own handmade abilities</a>. With Scribing, you can select a base Grimoire and tailor it with scripts to create an ability that perfectly fits your playstyle and build. </p>

				<p>With this new system, you'll discover a robust questline that has you restore an ancient Scholarium while diving deep into the mysteries of magicka in Tamriel. Whether you're looking for greater power, versatility, or roleplaying opportunities, Scribing introduces a powerful new way to tailor your builds and play your way. </p> 
				<p><b>Group Activities</b></p> 
				<p>In addition to the zone's multiple world bosses, delves, and public dungeons, <i>Gold Road</i> also introduces two new group activities to challenge you and your allies: the Lucent Citadel and Mirrormoor Incursions. </p> 
				<p>In the Lucent Citadel Trial, you and your large group (12 players total) must venture into a long-forgotten Daedric vault within the realm of Fargrave, contend with its unique boss encounters, and seek out the mysterious Arcane Knot. </p>

				<p>In addition to a new zone to explore, stories to experience, and challenges to overcome, the <i>Gold Road</i> Chapter is full of new Achievements, items, and collectibles for you to loot and earn. </p> 
				<p>Specifically, West Weald features 10 powerful item sets to loot and craft in addition to three unique Mythic items to uncover using the Antiquities system. Completing Achievements can also earn you a wide range of collectibles, such as style pages for King Nantharion's Royal Armor or even the Wildburn Lynx mount. </p>

				<p><b>Via the Gold Road Main Quest</b></p> 
				<p>You can have the game lead you to West Weald by picking up the Chapter's first main story quest, “Paths of Chaos.” You can find it by navigating to your Collections and then viewing Stories, selecting Chapter, and then Gold Road. </p> 
				<p><b>Via the Tutorial</b></p>

			<div class="modal-body">
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/06/86e7550fdc628bef6633f8e5c6ffa840.jpg" /><p><i>Honor the God of Commerce to receive hard work's rewards during the Zeal of Zenithar in-game event!</i></p> 
				<p><b>Update:</b> An earlier version of this article had incorrect information on the stock of Nenulaure, the Indrik Vendor. The information has now been updated below. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p><h2>Work Hard and Prosper</h2> 
				<p>The Zeal of Zenithar in-game event returns on June 20 at 10AM EDT, and it runs until July 2 at 10AM EDT. To get started, pick up the introductory quest "The Unrefusable Offer" from Amminus Varo at the Belkarth festival grounds or acquire the free quest starter from the Crown Store. Having trouble locating Belkarth? Don't worry; just head over to the nearest Impresario tent and take the nearby portal. Upon finishing the intro quest, you unlock the daily quest, "Honest Toil."</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/06/d71e555cee7f13e569acf66be881b4a9.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Seek Amminus Varo to begin your labors</i></p> 
				<p>During the event, the first time you complete the daily quest each day, you receive a Zenithar's Sublime Parcel box as a bonus reward. Each subsequent completion of the “Honest Toil” quest during that same day rewards you with a Zenithar's Delightful Parcel box.</p> 
				<p>In addition, you can earn Zenithar's Delightful Parcel boxes by participating in the following activities:</p> 
				<ul><li>Completing the introductory quest “The Unrefusable Offer”</li><li>Completing any Master Writ, per discipline, per account, each day</li><ul><li>Subsequent Master Writs of the same discipline won't provide further boxes until the daily reset</li></ul><li>First daily Crafting Writ, per account, completed each day</li><li>Each time you defeat a world boss while grouped with a player who is in at least one of your player guilds</li><li>Each time you complete a world event while grouped with a player who is in at least one of your player guilds</li></ul> 
				<p>You also have a <b>chance</b> to earn a Zenithar's Delightful Parcel box when conquering each round of a group-based arena challenge or completing a Cycle in the Infinite Archive while teamed up with a player who is a member of at least one of your guilds. Additionally, the final round's reward chest contains a guaranteed parcel, as will Tho'at Replicanum's reward chest.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Trade and toil </i></p> 
				<p>If (Divines forefend!) you aren't the sort to practice an honest trade, you may discover parcels scattered across Tamriel by pickpocketing citizens and looting strongboxes or thieves troves. Maybe crime does pay, as long as some other rube is doing the hard work first!</p> 
				<p>Within either parcel box (Sublime or Delightful), there is a chance to receive the following rewards:</p> 
				<ul><li>A tradeable outfit style page for the <b>new </b>Gold Road Dragoon outfit style armor</li><ul><li>If you've already earned a Gold Road Dragoon style page for the day, you have a chance to instead get a style page for a past Zeal of Zenithar event set such as the High Rock Spellsword outfit style armor, Kwama Miner's Kit armor outfit style, or Ashen Militia weapon outfit style.</li></ul><li>Durable crafting materials, provisioning ingredients, alchemy reagents, runestones, or a motif style item</li><li>Crafting boosters</li><ul><li>Chance to drop a gold-tier booster or a research time scroll</li></ul><li>Furnishing or provisioning recipes</li><li>Repair kits, siege repair kits, or a small chance for an Impresario Group Repair Kit</li><li>Treasure Maps, Survey Reports, Imperial City vault keys, Companion gear, or a random currency pouch.</li><ul><li>The random currency pouch can contain either gold or Tel Var stones; there is an extremely small chance that you discover a jackpot that allots 100,000 of the associated currency! </li><ul><li>The earnings from this pouch, jackpot or otherwise, are unaffected by any form of currency boosts</li></ul></ul></ul>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/06/7418b660301b1349c57d59fc47a7b634.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Honor the Divines as a Gold Road Dragoon</i></p> 
				<p>Both boxes can contain any of the above, but the Sublime Parcel boxes provide a higher chance to contain the more valuable rewards.</p> 
				<h2>Good Deeds Go Round Tamriel</h2> 
				<p>These boxes won't be the only bonus rewards you can enjoy during the Zeal of Zenithar event. Throughout the duration, you'll benefit from the following modified global in-game effects:</p> 
				<ul><li>Wayshrine travel costs are reduced by 75%</li><li>Repair costs on vendors are reduced by 50%</li><li>Crafting inspiration gain from all sources is increased by 100%</li><li>Vendor prices across Tamriel are reduced by 10%</li><ul><li>These include:</li><ul><li>Vendors that sell items for gold, AP, or Tel Var stones, including the Golden Vendor</li><li>Houses purchasable for gold</li></ul></ul></ul> 
				<h2>Event Tickets &amp; Vendors</h2> 
				<p>If you participate in the Zeal of Zenithar event, you also receive three Event Tickets the first time you complete the “Honest Toil” quest each day. By the end of the event, you can collect a whopping 39 tickets!</p> 
				<p>Thankfully, the Impresario is well-stocked to help you make good use of your gathered wealth. You'll even have your first opportunity to complete the Master of Schemes personality with the release of its third fragment.</p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Ensure your just rewards with masterful scheming</i></p><p>During the event period, the Impresario stocks:</p> <ul><li>All three Molag Bal Illusion Imp pet fragments</li><ul><li>Anchor Chain Fragment</li><li>Dark Anchor Pinion</li><li>Effigy of the Dominator</li></ul><li>All three Master of Schemes personality fragments</li><ul><li>Cold Iron Gauntlet</li><li>Grim Iron Mask</li><li>(NEW) Tyrant's Soul Gem</li></ul><li><b>NEW</b> bound style pages for the Gold Road Dragoon outfit style armor</li><li>Group Repair Kits</li><li>Companion Guild Commendations</li></ul><p>Additionally, during the event, the Impresario's Assistant Philius Dormier offers the following goodies:</p><ul><li>All three Unstable Morpholith pet fragments</li><ul><li>Deadlands Flint</li><li>Rune-Etched Striker</li><li>Smoldering Bloodgrass Tinder</li></ul><li>All three Deadlands Scorcher skin fragments</li><ul><li>Rune-Scribed Daedra Hide</li><li>Rune-Scribed Daedra Sleeve</li><li>Rune-Scribed Daedra Veil</li></ul><li>All three Soulfire Dragon Illusion pet fragments</li><ul><li>Hallowed Hourglass Basin</li><li>Illuminated Dragon Scroll</li><li>Kvatchian Incense</li></ul><li>All three Scales of Akatosh skin fragments</li><ul><li>Aureate Anointing Oils</li><li>Lustrous Ritual Sand</li><li>Sacred Scale</li></ul></ul><p>Last but certainly not least, the Indrik vendor Nenulaure's shop is stocked with the following items:<br></p><ul><li>Nascent Indrik Feathers</li><li>Luminous Indrik Berries</li><li>Icebreath Indrik Berries</li><li>Shimmering Indrik pet</li><li>Rimedusk Indrik pet</li></ul>

				<h2>Unravel the Mysteries of Magicka</h2> 
				<p>With the upcoming launch of <i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road</i> (arriving June 3 for PC/Mac and June 18 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles), you can explore the origins of magic in Tamriel via the all-new Scribing system. With Scribing, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yWOpQ6_T0M">create your own handmade abilities</a> with a near-limitless number of options available. </p> 
				<p>To celebrate this incredible new feature and Chapter launch, we're happy to announce the Anniversary Spotlight—Gold Road. Running from<b> June 3 until July 1 for PC/Mac </b>and <b>June 18 until July 16 for console players</b>, this new Anniversary Spotlight grants everyone who delves deep into the system <b>a special reward</b>. </p> 
				<h2>Unlock a Multi-Rider Mount</h2> 
				<p>What special reward? Complete the Scribing meta-achievement “Inheritor of the Scholarium” during the Anniversary Spotlight window and you can claim the coveted Wayrest Vanner Pillion Steed mount from the in-game Crown Store <b>for free</b>. </p> 
				<p>To unlock this achievement, you need to complete every quest in the Scribing questline (six in total) and restore the Scholarium. </p>

				<p>Note that you need <b>access to the Champion System</b> or have a <b>level 30 character</b> to begin the Scribing quest line. This mount can be claimed only during the promotion window (June 3 until July 1 for PC/Mac and June 18 until July 16 for console players)—get ready to prove your worth to the Luminaries of Magic! </p> 
				<h2>Endeavor to Craft New Abilities</h2> 
				<p>In addition to the unique achievement reward, after <i>Gold Road</i>'s launch, you'll discover a selection of Scribing-themed Endeavors to complete as well. These new Endeavors task you with using your custom-made abilities in your adventures throughout Tamriel, such as defeating enemies, healing your allies, and more. </p> 
				<p>Note that these Endeavors will reward you with the typical number of Seals you might expect from other similar tasks and won't be active until June 18 (when the <i>Gold Road</i> Chapter and Update 42 are live on all platforms). </p> 
				<h2>Celebrating ESO &amp; Gold Road</h2> 
				<p>With the upcoming launch of the new Chapter, we can't wait to see what kind of unique handcrafted abilities the community comes up with during the Anniversary Spotlight—Gold Road.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
				In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
				Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a target="_blank" href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
				If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
				We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.

				Hello everyone! After plenty of testing <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/discussion/632782/new-eso-launcher-testing-and-launch-plan-pc-and-mac">during the last PTS period</a>, we are pleased to announce the rollout of our new patcher on the live servers for PC/Mac. The rollout of the new patcher will happen in four phases, with new countries being added during each phase. As we give countries access to the new patcher, we will make note of it in the list below by noting next to the country name (has the new patcher.) We will also note what phase we are currently in by specifying whether it has not started, in progress, or complete, next to the phase number. The countries getting the patcher are listed in order below.<br><br>
				Thanks for your patience as we roll this out to all countries listed below. A special thanks to everyone who helped test out the launcher during the last PTS and provided feedback.<br><br>
				Edit for 3/4/2024: All phases have now been complete.<br><br><b>Phase 1 (Complete) </b>
				<ol><li>Netherlands (Has the new patcher)</li>
				<li>Sweden (Has the new patcher)</li>
				<li>Czech Republic/ Finland (Has the new patcher)</li>
				<li>Norway/ Denmark (Has the new patcher)</li>
				<li>Hungary/ Switzerland/ Romania (Has the new patcher)</li>
				</ol><br><b>Phase 2 (Complete) </b>

				This phase will encompass all other countries where ESO is available, that are not listed above. (All countries where ESO is available now have access to the launcher.)<br><br><b>Known Issues</b>
				<ul><li>Some Czech Republic players may not have their country recognized, thus making them unable to upgrade the patch at this time. We are aware of the issue and working toward a solution.</li>
				<li>Audio issues with sound volume and sound effects. We have a bug in for this and are working on a fix for the future.</li>
