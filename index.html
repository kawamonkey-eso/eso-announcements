				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Prove your mettle to Predicant Maera</i></p> 
				<p>Unlike previous years, you will no longer need to obtain or use the Scroll of Pelinal's Ferocity to enjoy the 100% buff to Alliance Point, XP, and Tel Var Stone gains. These bonuses will now be shared passively to adventurers competing throughout Cyrodiil, the Imperial City, and Battlegrounds. </p> 
				<p>Now that the Scroll of Pelinal's Ferocity isn't required to enjoy these boons, there will be no way to pick up the Scroll anywhere in-game, and those who already own the item will notice it no longer serves any function.</p>

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>

				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/e616bdb61ba3bb4e6bd6d96fbf82ea12.jpg" /><p><i>Discover new ways to play with Scribing, arriving as part of The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road. </i></p> 
				<p>In <i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road </i>(arriving June 3 on PC/Mac and June 18 on Xbox and PlayStation consoles), you can unlock access to an all-new game system: Scribing. With Scribing, you can manipulate the nature of magic itself by collecting and customizing special skills, granting you even more ways to tailor specific builds and play your way. </p> 
				<h2>Customize New Skills</h2> 
				<p>When designing this new system, the team focused on improving opportunities for roleplay and choice for <i>ESO</i>'s adventurers by providing greater agency when it comes to selecting and adapting the skills that are right for them. What exactly does this mean for you and your characters? Scribing introduces Grimoires, which are new types of skills for your existing skill lines. You can customize these Grimoires beyond their basic functions, transforming them into exactly what you want on your action bar. </p> 
				<p>For example, one new Grimoire, called Soul Touch, allows you to pull soul magic from the core of your being and cast it at a nearby enemy or ally. You can customize Soul Touch by choosing its Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Scripts. You could use the Primary to create a Damage Shield for an ally, pull an enemy to you, or even change it to Magic, Shock, or Physical Damage. In addition, you could use the Soul Infusion Secondary to enable the ability to consume a soul gem and gain Ultimate, or you can use a Recovery Secondary to regain resources for a targeted ally.</p>
				<img src="https://esossl-a.akamaihd.net/uploads/website/Q3ZeOwb7aw/s41bng_preview.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Customize your Grimoires with Scripts</i></p> 
				<p>The above is just one example, but the Scribing system will give you a ton of new ways to change your build and playstyle, since you can unlock a host of Grimoires and Scripts at launch. </p> 
				<h2>Explore the Origins of Magic</h2> 
				<p>To master the art of Scribing you'll need the <i>Gold Road </i>Chapter, which grants access to a brand-new questline. In this unique story, ancient magic arising in the world attracts the attention of the Mages Guild, who send one of their best to investigate. </p> 
				<p>Working alongside a brave Knight of the Lamp, you'll discover a mysterious new location and altar and discover the secrets of the mage who built it. Throughout the questline, you'll learn how to scribe, gain a Grimoire or two, and meet new friends along the way.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/862d82507bb6a5d566ac10fc40af81d1.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Ally with the Luminaries of magic</i></p> 
				<p>Fantastic untold lore awaits those willing to delve into the esoteric mysteries of magic, but those who commit to unraveling its secrets will find new power and freedom as they do. </p> 
				<h2>Style Your Existing Skills, Too! </h2> 
				<p>With the ability to mix and match a wide variety of classes, races, skills, and gear sets, <i>ESO</i> has always striven to provide you with the freedom and power to customize your characters' unique playstyles. </p> 
				<p>In the spirit of this core pillar, <i>Gold Road</i> also introduces a new type of collectible, called Skill Styles. Skill Styles are color variation of popular abilities from various weapon, guild, and world skill lines, helping you further stand out on the battlefield. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/995744a34de5715f92ef734cc8d5ed38.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Customize existing abilities with Skill Styles</i></p> 
				<p>At the launch of <i>Gold Road</i>, you can unlock these Skill Styles as in-game rewards, but there's a lot more planned for them beyond the Chapter, too.</p> 
				<h2>Play Your Way</h2> 
				<p><i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road</i>'s new Scribing system will be a powerful and flexible new tool for Tamriel's adventurers, and we can't wait to see how the community reacts to it.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/0b177a588e1c2d830a4408eb434f3ad9.jpg" /><p><i>Discover West Weald, ESO's newest zone just announced as part of The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road!</i></p><h2>Explore West Weald</h2> <p>In <i>ESO</i>'s upcoming <i>Gold Road</i> Chapter (arriving June 3 for PC/Mac and June 18 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles) you can explore and quest within the West Weald zone, which introduces brand-new locations, characters, challenges, rewards, and stories. If you're already familiar with southeast Cyrodiil, this Chapter allows you to explore this bountiful part of Tamriel for the first time since 2006's <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. </i></p> <p>Recently, strange happenings have thrown the region into turmoil, changing the landscape in bizarre ways and introducing new threats you'll have to contend with. In the southeast lies the Gold Road, a temperate environment similar to that found on the Gold Coast. It's home to the region's capital city, Skingrad, the bustling center of the zone and lynchpin for the Colovian Imperials who call the province home. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/6c423bf1ee34492fa4f12665295066b6.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Discover (or rediscover) Skingrad</i></p> 
				<p>Toward the southwest, you will find Dawnwood. Formerly under Imperial control, this area is now home to the encroaching jungles of nearby Valenwood. There, you'll discover a dense wilderness and the Wood Elf settlement of Vashabar. Even more alarming is the Wildburn, a dangerous area that separates Dawnwood from the Colovian Highlands and Gold Road, comprised of sickened, magically twisted land and even more warped beasts. </p> 
				<p>In the north of West Weald lies the Colovian Highlands, a mountainous region that is home to an Imperial settlement and numerous ruins. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/0132c96d607b2c17834eff2d9e101c41.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Venture into ancient Ayleid ruins</i></p> 
				<p>Classic Colovian architecture inspired many of the zone's structures, although as you explore its varied terrain you'll also encounter many Ayleid ruins that speak to an older heritage. These ruins are less “spoiled” than many other similar locations and show off structures and architectural pieces of Ayleid culture never seen before.</p> 
				<h2>New Challenges and Rewards</h2> 
				<p>While the land itself is changing, it is also under attack from a host of new, unfamiliar foes, bringing all-new dangers to West Weald's adventurers. </p> 
				<p>These challenges include new delves and public dungeons to explore, world bosses to face, and a bevy of stand-alone quests that tell stories unique to this zone. In addition, new world events, called Mirrormoor Incursions, set you and your fellow adventurers against waves of invading Daedra. </p> 
				<p><i>Gold Road</i> also introduces a 12-player Trial, the Lucent Citadel, which has you and your band venture into a long-forgotten Daedric vault—new bosses, mysteries, and rewards await! </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/b3f88397b7ef3c74acc22192a8210d3d.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Prepare for a new Trial</i></p> 
				<p>Speaking of rewards, if you venture into the zone, you'll find that West Weald is home to no shortage of new riches. This includes 10 item sets to wear, more Antiquities to dig up, fun collectibles to unlock, and a host of Achievements and Titles to earn. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/476564f980c157efe4fb816337f842de.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Seize the treasures of West Weald</i></p> 
				<p>Finally, <i>Gold Road</i> also introduces an entirely new type of reward collectible called Skill Styles, which provide visual changes to popular abilities, with more planned for future updates!</p> 
				<h2>Wonders Old and New Await</h2> 
				<p>The return of Ithelia and the Wildburn introduces threats both old and new in West Weald. Will you meet these rising dangers?

				<h2>The Forgotten Prince</h2> 
				<p>A secret long held by Hermaeus Mora has been uncovered and the existence of the Forgotten Prince has come to light. Now, Ithelia's return puts reality itself at risk.</p> 
				<p>Arriving March 11 for PC/Mac and March 26 for Xbox and Playstation consoles, the <i>Scions of Ithelia </i>dungeon DLC pack continues the story from last year's <i>Necrom</i> Chapter. Learn more about the spreading threat via the two dungeons featured in this pack, then experience its stunning conclusion in the upcoming Chapter, <i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road</i> (arriving June 3 for PC/Mac and June 18 for consoles).</p> 
				<h2>Scions of Ithelia</h2> 
				<p>Begin 2024's adventures with the <i>Scions of Ithelia</i> dungeon DLC pack in March, which introduces two new 4-player dungeons, <b>Oathsworn Pit</b> and <b>Bedlam Veil</b>. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/0f8e293fb7357fbc6fb495ff3d1fe216.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Scions of Ithelia</i></p> 
				<p>These dungeons allow you to explore a training ground for the followers of Malacath and a secret vault within the Oblivion demi-realm of Maelstrom. Both dungeons help set the stage for the upcoming Chapter in their own way, but their storylines can be enjoyed individually, too.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/8d3598bca482bc066b10f4d0ba031dcf.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Battle the followers of the Forgotten Prince</i></p> 
				<p>These two new dungeons are set to challenge you and your team with Normal and Veteran difficulties (including Hard Mode) and each feature their own Achievements and rewards (including unique collectibles and item sets).</p> 
				<h2>Gold Road Chapter</h2> 
				<p>Featuring a new zone, storyline, Scribing system, rewards, and more, The<i> Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road</i> is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/joinus">now available for pre-purchase on all platforms</a>. This new Chapter takes you to West Weald, a region situated on the borders of Cyrodiil, the Gold Coast, and Valenwood. Those <i>Elder Scroll</i>s fans who played 2006's <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> might be familiar with this part of Tamriel, including its capital city of Skingrad. </p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/f2cd8a3b84c6f30e3f4845e3871d9ec8.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road</i></p> 
				<p>Ruled by the Colovian Count Calantius, this province is an independent nation allied to the Imperial forces occupying nearby Cyrodiil. However, seemingly overnight, the sweltering jungles of Valenwood have replaced a third of the region, and the Count seeks answers to avoid losing any more of his realm.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/57157de818d13beccec9405bffeefba9.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The unraveling of reality is everyone's problem</i></p> 
				<p>That said, the new forest (that the Wood Elves call Dawnwood) may not be the most pressing concern for you and your allies, as you must also investigate the reappearance of Ithelia, the Forgotten Prince.</p>
				<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/01/5328189025afe0c9fdaea85b654c8a59.jpg" />
				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Beware the Scions of Ithelia</i></p> 
				<p>While her followers cause chaos in her name, many mysteries remain. Why does she now walk West Weald, and what are her Scions' plans for her return? Reality itself hangs in the balance! While it continues a narrative that began in 2023, like <i>Scions of Ithelia</i>, <i>Gold Road</i> tells its own stand-alone tale and does not require having played the <i>Necrom </i>Chapter.</p> 
				<h2>A Clash of Fates</h2> 
				<p>The Forgotten Prince may soon return to power, and fate itself trembles in anticipation. What impact will you, a mortal adventurer, have on West Weald and its myriad threats? You'll have to play <i>Gold Road</i> to find out!</p> 
				<p>In the meantime, let us know your hopes and predictions for how this conflict will play out via <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TESOnline">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elderscrollsonline/">Instagram</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/elderscrollsonline">Facebook</a>.

				<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Molag Bal Illusion Imp Pet</i></p>

				<p>· Effigy of the Dominator</p> 
				<p>These three fragments will be available for purchase with Event Tickets during each of 2024's major in-game events. Just visit the Impresario during any of her appearances throughout the year to acquire them. Once you have all three fragments, combine them in your Collections to unlock access to this malevolent mite.</p> 
				<p>As a morphing collectible, the Molag Bal Illusion Imp can also be combined with other fragments to summon a different collectible event reward each quarter of this year, starting with the <b>Planemeld's Master Body and Face Markings</b>.</p>

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
				In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
				Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a target="_blank" href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
				If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
				We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.

				<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
				Hello everyone! After plenty of testing <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/discussion/632782/new-eso-launcher-testing-and-launch-plan-pc-and-mac">during the last PTS period</a>, we are pleased to announce the rollout of our new patcher on the live servers for PC/Mac. The rollout of the new patcher will happen in four phases, with new countries being added during each phase. As we give countries access to the new patcher, we will make note of it in the list below by noting next to the country name (has the new patcher.) We will also note what phase we are currently in by specifying whether it has not started, in progress, or complete, next to the phase number. The countries getting the patcher are listed in order below.<br><br>
				Thanks for your patience as we roll this out to all countries listed below. A special thanks to everyone who helped test out the launcher during the last PTS and provided feedback.<br><br><b>Phase 1 (Complete) </b>
				<ol><li>Netherlands (Has the new patcher)</li>

				<li>Audio issues with sound volume and sound effects. We have a bug in for this and are working on a fix for the future.</li>
