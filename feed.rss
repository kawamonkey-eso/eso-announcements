            <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 20:22:11 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're planning to spend some time in Tamriel this October, there's 31 great reasons why you should log in to <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i>. You can see just some of the daily rewards you can claim next month below, but if you'd like to find out more about Daily Login Rewards in general, <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/41950">check out this help article</a>. </p> 
<p><b>Grand Gold Coast Experience Scroll ×2—Day 7</b></p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/06/1f7bf97587039a52547d3df74a2632bc.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Level up quick!</i></p> 
<p>Get ready to dive into the Endless Archive by leveling up fast with two EXP Scrolls, each granting a 150% boost to experience gains.</p> 
<p><b>Seals of Endeavor ×250—Day 14</b></p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/09/1cfb418981bec3aee26d7c3a05265b75.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Claim 250 of these on day 14!</i></p> 
<p>Got your eye on any Crown Crate items? In its first appearance for the Daily Rewards system, Seals of Endeavor were previously earned only by completing daily and weekly Endeavors. You can learn more about <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/59925">Seals of Endeavor in this blog</a>. </p> 
<p><b>Ash Hopper Chomp Emote—Day 21</b></p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/09/1ca7df6e7625fb74256b02576b86cdec.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>A Green Pact-approved meal</i></p> 
<p>Ash hoppers are typically native to Vvardenfell (but certainly found in other equally inhospitable locations), so it is perhaps unsurprising that the Dark Elves have incorporated these creatures into their <i>already</i> <i>formidable</i> local cuisine. This emote proves once more that there's no accounting for taste.</p> 
<p>These are just some of the rewards you can claim during October, so be sure to log in to the game on the first day of the month to see the complete list. You can find it within the Daily Rewards section of the in-game Crown Store. Do any of these items tickle your fancy? Will you be taking a big bite out of some giant insect legs?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/08/2e966846125f5b8145838f4247202990.jpg" /><p><i>Discover the host of additions and improvements arriving with the free Update 39 base-game patch. </i></p> <p>The Update 39 base-game patch is now live PC/Mac, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, and introduces a series of long-awaited improvements and additions to <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i>, completely free of charge for all existing <i>ESO</i> players.<br></p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/08/2aae9b31906a3c66e2128b4d1cf5b7d1.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Update 39 Base Game Improvements</i></p> 
<p>As a base-game patch, Update 39 includes a wide array of bug fixes, but also features a series of long-awaited improvements to your in-game experience. </p> 
<p><b>Quest &amp; Content Improvements for New Players</b></p> 
<p>If you're a new player feeling overwhelmed when first entering Tamriel, you can enjoy a series of changes that <b>reduce the volume and frequency of quests </b>offered to your low-level characters. This includes quests from NPCs for the main story, Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, Battlegrounds, Undaunted, and others. Instead, these quests are now delivered more gradually as you level up, helping your journal stay in a manageable state for longer!</p> 
<p>Tamriel's navigator NPCs that can transport your characters between destinations have also received some improvements with this update. Now, these navigators <b>indicate whether they can transport you to a location for one of your tracked quests</b> (active or inactive.) When exploring, you now see the “door” pin above relevant navigator NPCs, indicating that they can help you in your journey. In addition, appropriate dialog lines with those same NPCs have similar pins, ensuring you make the right choice and go where you need to go—happy travels! </p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/08/71d1ea150e994d1d9a33e1959bbe5942.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Taking your first steps into Tamriel is daunting</i></p> 
<p><b>Inventory Management Improvements</b></p> 
<p>If you're struggling with an overburdened Inventory, Update 39 also includes changes to key item types to help improve management and reduce clutter. Some (but not all) similar Crown Store items that came from separate sources (such as Tri-Restoration Potions) can now all be <b>stacked together using the “Stack All Items” option</b>. Also, this patch adds <b>better communication regarding which items in your Inventory can or cannot be sold</b>, helping you identify and clear out unwanted items and make a little gold in the process!</p> 
<p><b>PvP Additions &amp; New Rewards </b></p> 
<p>This update adds new rewards for Tamriel's PvP victors in the form of <b>three new monster mask sets</b>: Jerall Mountains Warchief, Nibenay Bay Battlereeve, and Colovian Highlands General. Each grants unique and powerful boons, and you can trade Alliance Points for these new masks with Cyrodiil Elite Gear Vendors within the Eastern Elsweyr Gate, Southern High Rock Gate, and Northern Morrowind Gate. </p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/07/02adb5389ad204fbd8e6c9ce6240f7d4.png" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Chase down new PvP rewards</i></p> 
<p>In addition, you can now claim <b>new Unfeathered Battle Body and Face Markings</b> from Gladiator's Rucksacks (earned by completing Cyrodiil Conquest Mission Board daily quests), and the Imperial City's hapless <b>Treasure Scamps now</b> <b>drop even better loot </b>when hunted down. In particular, Cunning Scamps drop more Tel Var Stones and Trove Scamps drop tradable pieces of Imperial City gear sets. </p> 
<p>Finally, while battling in Cyrodiil, the Imperial City, and Battlegrounds, you can now see <b>new death notifications</b> that help you plan your next move (or avoid that incoming zerg!).</p> 
<p><b>Home Editor Improvements</b></p> 
<p>With Update 39, this patch gives you the ability to <b>place a furnishing directly from your Inventory or Collectibles UI </b>while in your home. You can now find a “Place” option when viewing the specific furnishings. In addition, you can <b>preview Crown Store furnishings</b> in your home before you buy, helping you determine how a new item might look when placed. </p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2023/08/1c12c700d99b7f15c2d3bffeba283673.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Place furnishings from Inventory and Collectibles</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Look for Serileth!</i></p> 
<h2>Undaunted Rewards</h2> 
<p>Tamriel's dungeons are challenging PvE encounters, but throughout the event, big dangers can also lead to big rewards.

You can open this unique container to receive various reward items including gold, consumables, style pages, Undaunted Keys, Opal Weapon styles, and more. </p>

<p>After you have defeated your first final dungeon boss each day, keep going! Subsequent final dungeon bosses reward regular Undaunted Reward boxes, which can include the following goods:</p> 
<ul><li>A guaranteed drop of an item set piece from the dungeon in which the box was acquired.</li><li>A guaranteed drop of one of the following items:</li><ul><li>A random motif style page from the following:</li><ul><li>Ascendant Order</li><li>Bloodforge</li><li>Crimson Oath</li><li>Dreadsail</li><li>Fang Lair</li><li>Huntsman</li><li>Hazardous Alchemy</li><li>Icereach</li><li>Mazzatun</li><li>Moongrave Fane</li><li>Pyre Watch</li><li>Silken Ring</li><li>Scalecaller</li><li>Silver Dawn</li><li>Stags of Z'en</li><li>Silver Rose</li><li>Thorn Legion</li><li>True Sworn</li><li>Waking Flame</li></ul></ul><li>1,000 Gold</li><li>An Undaunted Key</li><li>A Crown Repair Kit</li><li>A Riding Lesson</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi all,<br><br>
We wanted to give everyone some visibility into a couple of issues we are currently tracking involving the Dungeon Finder.<br><br>
The first is a recurring issue where some group members appear to be offline after you port into a dungeon or are not ported at all. We've been working on a fix for this that will hopefully make it into U39.<br><br>
The other issue relates to queueing as a group for a dungeon, specifically as a Tank or Healer. We've seen reports where these roles take longer than intended to get matched into a group, and after some investigating, we found there is indeed a problem here when certain conditions are met. While we work on addressing this, we want to offer some additional information that you can leverage as a workaround in the meantime:<br><ul><li>In 3-person groups:
<ul><li>Tank, Healer and Direct Damage (DD) combination: If the Tank or Healer is the group lead, the LFG queue times will be significantly longer than if the DD is the group lead.</li>
<li>2 DD and a Healer, or 2 DD and a Tank: If the Tank or Healer is group lead, the LFG queue times will be slightly longer than if the DD is the group lead, but to a much lesser extent than the Tank/Healer/DD combo above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>4-person groups do not appear to be impacted by this issue in any way.</li>
</ul>
Until we can get a fix for this, we suggest <b>queuing up with the DD as group leader for any 3 person groups</b> so you get through the queues much quicker.<br>]]></content:encoded>
