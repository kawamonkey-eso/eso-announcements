            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/07/b26b7108bae413a9c1cebbd2d7fa75b1.jpg" /><p><i>Go toe-to-toe with your fellow players across Cyrodiil, the Imperial City, and Battlegrounds all while collecting exciting in-game rewards during the Whitestrake's Mayhem PvP event!</i></p> 
<h2>Mayhem Is On the Rise</h2> 
<p>The Whitestrake's Mayhem event makes its grand return to Tamriel next Thursday, July 25 at 10AM EDT, and runs until August 6 at 10AM EDT. Throughout the event, you will benefit from a 100% bonus to Alliance Point, XP, and Tel Var Stone gain. In addition, you can earn unique goodies by participating in <i>ESO</i>'s PvP game modes.</p> 
<p>Ready to clash against other adventurers on the battlefield? Simply follow the steps below:</p> 
<ol><li>Head over to the in-game Crown Store and receive the “Details on the Whitestrake's Mayhem" quest</li><li>Travel to your Alliance War faction's main gate in Cyrodiil using the Alliance War menu or a Battlegrounds camp outside major cities</li><ol><li>You do not need to travel to Cyrodiil to start the event</li></ol><li>Locate the NPC named “Predicant Maera" and continue the quest</li><ol><li>Note that if you've previously completed the quest, you won't need to do it again</li></ol><li>Complete the quest to receive a complimentary Pelinal's Boon Box</li></ol>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/07/dcf9721d1b9361d959ce7db76d5c1dcc.jpg" />
<p>One key difference from previous years' events is that you no longer need to obtain or use the Scroll of Pelinal's Ferocity to benefit from the 100% buff to Alliance Point, XP, and Tel Var Stone gains. These bonuses are now shared passively to adventurers skirmishing throughout Cyrodiil, the Imperial City, and Battlegrounds. As a result, there is no longer a method to pick up the Scroll of Pelinal's Ferocity anywhere in-game, and those who already own the item will now notice it no longer offers any functionality.</p> 
<h2>Battle for Bonus Rewards</h2> 
<p>While participating in the Whitestrake's Mayhem in-game event, you can amass a collection of bonus in-game goodies for your heroic efforts. </p> 
<p><b>NEW—Ayleid Lich Outfit Style Armor</b></p> 
<p>Dominate both the living and the dead while donning the Ayleid Lich Armor, dropped in Pelinal's Boon Boxes.</p> 
<p><b>Pelinal's Boon Boxes</b></p> 
<p>You can earn Pelinal's Boon Boxes as rewards from the following activities throughout the event:</p> 
<ul><li>Battlegrounds quests from Battlemaster Rivyn</li><li>Scouting, Battle, Warfront, and Conquest Missions</li><li>Elder Scroll capture and recapture quests</li><li>Town quests in Vlastarus, Bruma, Cropsford, Cheydinhal, and Chorrol</li><li>Imperial City daily quests</li></ul> 
<p>Whenever you open a Pelinal's Boon Box, you have the chance to receive the following items:</p> 
<ul><li>Parcel of Tel Var Stones</li><li>Cyrodiil repair kit</li><li>Soul Gems</li><li><b>ONE</b> of the following:</li><ul><li>Alchemy Ingredients </li><li>Style item for your Alliance's armor style </li><li>Style item for Akaviri armor style </li><li>Daedric siege weapon </li><li>Whitestrake's Mayhem book furnishing</li><li>Forward Camp for your Alliance</li><li>Chapter of your Alliance's armor motif</li><ul><li>There is a small chance that the full book may drop instead of a single chapter</li></ul><li>Prismatic Runestone </li><li>Chapter for the Akaviri armor motif</li><ul><li>There is a small chance that the full book may drop instead of a single chapter</li></ul><li>Small chance to receive one or two fragments of the Alliance Breton Terrier pet</li></ul><li>Small chance to receive a Transmute Geode</li><li>Very small chance to receive an unbound, tradeable Ayleid Lich Armor Style Page</li><ul><li>A Dovah's Du'ul Style Page may drop instead if you've already earned the Ayleid Lich Armor Style Page</li></ul></ul>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/07/08b6d9726209e1d787a6a20bff1014ec.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Ayleid Lich Armor Style</i></p> 
<p><b>Bonus Resources &amp; The Golden</b></p> 
<p>Are you a crafter? Keep a keen eye out as you travel from battle to battle as harvesting nodes in Cryodiil will yield additional resources throughout the event. </p> 
<p>Additionally, the merchant Adhazabi “The Golden” Aba-daro will offer various CP160 jewelry from Cyrodiil item sets. Legendary necklaces will be available during the first weekend of Whitestrake's Mayhem and legendary rings from the same sets will be offered during the second. </p> 
<p>Throughout the celebration, The Golden will not offer Monster Masks and all purchases in her shop will require Alliance Points. Contrary to her title, she will <b>not</b> accept gold.</p> 
<h2>The Impresario &amp; Event Tickets</h2> 
<p>During Whitestrake's Mayhem, up to three Event Tickets can be earned each day by completing the following activities:</p> 
<ul><li>Two Event Tickets from the first Cyrodiil or Battlegrounds daily quest </li><ul><li>This includes Bounty Board quests, a Town Daily, the Conquest Board quests, or the daily Battlegrounds quest</li></ul><li>One Event Ticket from an Imperial City District daily quest</li></ul> 
<p>You can obtain a total of <b>39</b> Event Tickets by the event's end. Remember: you can only hold up to 12 Event Tickets at one time. Be sure to stop by the Impresario's market now and again to clear the way to collect more Tickets!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We are currently investigating an issue that emerged after the Gold Road and Update 42 maintenance on Xbox and PlayStation servers where some players are missing the Jubilee Steed after previously earning it during this year's Anniversary Jubilee event in April. Players who are affected by this will also see their "Jubilee Confetti Conveyor" achievement progress reset to zero. This is occurring on the Xbox and PlayStation servers.<br><br>
While investigations are ongoing, we will ensure that any players affected by this issue get the Jubilee Steed back. We do not need affected players to submit a Support Ticket at this time. We will follow up here and in <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/660761/jubilee-mount-missing-ps5">this discussion thread</a> as we have more information to share.<br><br>
Thank you!,Hi everyone! We have identified the issue on Xbox and PlayStation servers and are working on a fix. We plan to push this fix during the next console incremental patch, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, July 10. Here's what you need to know, once the fix is live:
<ul><li>If you had the Jubilee Steed and completed the "Jubilee Confetti Conveyor" achievement before, you will have the mount back and your achievement will once again be complete.</li>
<li>If you had <i>partial</i> progress towards the "Jubilee Confetti Conveyor" achievement completion, we will bump you back to where you were before the Update 42 launch on consoles.</li>
<li>If you use Jubilee Confetti Packs before the fix goes live, you will lose that progress toward the "Jubilee Confetti Conveyor" achievement when it does. We encourage you not to use any additional Jubilee Confetti Packs until after the fix is live on July 10.</li>
</ul>
Players affected by this issue do not need to submit a Support Ticket. Thank you all for your patience.,Hi All. We're updating to note that this issue has been resolved with today's patch. You should be able to use your Jubilee Steed Mount once again. Thanks again for your patience while resolving this issue.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn about Home Tours, updates to the Infinite Archive, and more with our sneak peek at Update 43!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/07/a485860acb4ef7db7339db29ead9f8ec.jpg" /><p><i>Learn about Home Tours, updates to the Infinite Archive, and more with our sneak peek at Update 43!</i></p> 
<p>The Update 43 base-game patch is set to bring a ton of great features and improvements to all <i>ESO</i> players,<b> completely free of charge</b>, on August 19 for PC/Mac and September 4 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles. </p> 
<p>Eager to check it out? You can test out the new update for yourself on the PC/Mac Public Test Server early next week—keep an eye out for the announcement blog! If you missed the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2188253758">preview livestream</a>, or just want more details, check out what's coming below. </p> 
<h2>Home Tours</h2> 
<p>One of the year's most anticipated new features for Tamriel's housing enthusiasts is Home Tours, a new entry in the Activity Finder that shares and showcases listed player homes. </p> 
<p>With Home Tours, you can search for homes owned and decorated by another player you know by searching for their UserID. You can also filter through other criteria like owner-applied labels for theme, such as “Libraries” or “Strongholds.” Of course, the creativity of many players defies such simple categorization, so if you're interested in seeing all sorts of homes or in viewing the most popular creations, you can browse the top player homes in the Recommended tab of Home Tours. Whatever way you search, friends and guildmates will be specially tagged in the feed for easy recognition. </p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/07/1fb5d9343a4564711c639ddeada956f3.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Tour Tamriel together!</i></p> 
<p>When you find a home that really impresses you, you can recommend it to others, as well as favorite it for yourself to visit later. You can even favorite homes you visit through other means, regardless of whether they are listed for Home Tours. There's a weekly limit on how many homes you can recommend, but no limit on how many you can visit and enjoy. Your own home may be featured as a recommended home in the Activity Finder if it becomes popular enough! </p> 
<h2>Infinite Archive Update</h2> 
<p>Update 43 also adds more depth to the Infinite Archive in the form of new maps, enemies, Verses and Visions, and updated loot, including new class item sets! This includes new hazard stages where the Archive itself presents a danger and a wider pool of foes to battle in maligraphic form. </p> 
<p>Helping you tackle these new challenges are eight additional Verses and 10 additional Visions. For example, you can use the new Phalanx verse to call on ghostly soldiers to form a wall of defenders, collect the new Necrotic Vision set to unlock an Undead Avatar transformation that allows you to empower yourself with each defeated enemy, and more. You can also earn potent new consumable items that unlock a guaranteed transformation verse like the Undead Avatar, but getting them will not be easy!</p> 
<p>Once you return to the Index with your hard-won Archival Fortunes, you can spend them on new rewards, whether as part of Filer Ool's rotating stock or purchased from new arrival Filer Brax, who stocks all gear from the class item sets. Filer Brax's inventory isn't limited to the existing seven sets from the Archive's launch, but also includes new sets like the gruesome Corpseburster set for Necromancers that detonates corpses your skills consume. <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/64891">As before</a>, each of these sets is themed around a specific class skill line.</p> 
<h2>Quality of Life Improvements</h2> 
<p>The above new features and additions aren't the only focus of Update 43. Several smaller improvements included in Update 43 are aimed at making your time in Tamriel easier and more enjoyable. </p> 
<p>For example, item curation, the system that prevents duplicate item drops within a set while you are still filling it out in Collections, expands to cover new sources. These include weekly Trial rewards, offerings from Imperial City vendors, and the Dungeon-specific reward chests for monster sets available for Undaunted Keys from Glirion the Redbeard, Maj-al Ragath, and Urgarlag Chief-bane at the Undaunted Enclaves. </p> 
<p>The update also includes improvements to mount previews in the Crown Store, allowing you to preview and replay animations such as summoning or rearing up without needing to purchase a mount. Finally, many further smaller changes and bug fixes are included in Update 43. For example, Guild Trader and Guild Bank interfaces remember the last player Guild you interacted with in a play session.</p> 
<p>Update 43 brings a host of new features, improvements, and fixes to Tamriel's adventurers, and you can test them out for yourself on PTS next week. Keep an eye out for those patch notes, too!

<p><i>This construct resembles a great and fearsome Bone Dragon, but it's actually a product of the Necromancer's art, assembled from modern bird and reptile bones and then reanimated.</i></p>

<p><i>The legend among the underworld explorers of the Undaunted is that these little incendiary sprites are responsible for lighting all the candles, torches, and lanterns found burning underground, flying ahead of adventurers to ignite them in the dark.</i></p>

<p><i>The pups of the Helkarn Wolves from Elsweyr are almost as sociable with people as dog puppies, so they get a lot of attention when young. This probably contributes to their docility as mounts when full grown.</i></p>

<h2>Recall in Autumnal Style </h2> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/anniversary">10-Year Anniversary Celebration</a> continues with a new spotlight, and this time, we're taking you and your allies to the Dark Elf island home of Vvardenfell and Sotha Sil's world in miniature. From July 2 until August 15, you can unlock the ability to claim the Gold Road Recall Customized Action for FREE from the in-game Crown Store when you complete the Champion of Vivec Achievement. </p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/06/d6f12ee627485a66a3d582c800d6b801.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Gold Road Recall</i></p> 
<p>Customized Actions allow you to change the animation and effects for specific in-game actions, such as harvesting and, in this case, recalling. To earn the Champion of Vivec Achievement, complete the Vvardenfell zone storyline and restore the demi-god's lost power. </p> 
<h2>Claim Clockwork City </h2> 
<p>In addition to the Customized Action, you can also unlock the <i>Clockwork City</i> DLC free with July's Daily Login Rewards. Simply log in during the month of July and claim the DLC on Day 2—easy! </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Venture into Clockwork City</i></p> 
<p>In the <i>Clockwork City</i> DLC, you can explore one of Seht's most incredible (and dangerous) creations: an entire world in miniature. This unique zone has its own storyline, challenges, and characters to discover, plus it's a long-time favorite of the <i>ESO</i> community. If you've not yet had the chance to explore the Clockwork City (or are yet to own the DLC outright), this is your opportunity to do so! </p> 
<h2>Endeavor into Morrowind</h2> 
<p>During the Anniversary Spotlight period, you can also enjoy themed Endeavors, allowing you to earn Seals by completing activities such as destroying clockwork foes, slaying public dungeon bosses in Vvardenfell, clearing the Halls of Fabrication, and more. Keep an eye out for them!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi all. We're gathering some feedback regarding the Environmental Sustainability Features added in U42. Specifically, we would like feedback on the following patch note:
<ul><li>Reduced GPU use in Contextual Menus (Xbox Series X|S and PS5): When viewing most menus, (eg. managing inventory, achievements, quest journal, etc) framerate is now capped to 30fps. Some menus are exempt on a case-by-case basis (eg. conversations, various mini-games). Testing in Performance Mode while in these menus shows a 50% reduction in GPU consumption, resulting in overall power consumption going from approximately 63% of the maximum possible on a console down to 37%.</li>
</ul>
We're seeing your feedback about menus capped to 30fps is causing issues for some of you. Please let us know how it is impacting your play experience. We are sharing this with our teams to better inform them of your feedback and how we can improve the experience overall. Additionally, if you are experiencing other framerate issues with either your menus or player character, please note those here as well. Thanks, all.]]></content:encoded>

This new Chapter for <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i> introduces a new zone to explore, West Weald, along with a new system to master called Scribing. It also concludes the story of Ithelia, the Forgotten Prince, which began with 2023's Shadows Over Morrowind saga. </p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/05/459638ba6ddd36869757f1ff8004d442.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Forgotten Prince returns</i></p> 
<p>In addition to the Chapter, this release also includes the U42 base-game patch, introducing a host of bug fixes, balance changes, and other improvements free for all <i>ESO </i>players. You can view the full patch notes for <i>Gold Road</i> and Update 42 <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/patch-notes">on our official forums</a>. </p> 
<h2>Gold Road Chapter</h2> 
<p>In <i>The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road</i> you can venture into the heart of Colovian Imperial culture as you unravel the mystery of the return of a never-before-seen Daedric Prince—Ithelia. While <i>Gold Road</i> continues (and concludes) the Shadow Over Morrowind narrative that began in 2023, you can experience and enjoy the latest Chapter's storyline without having to play any of the game's previous content. </p> 
<p><b>West Weald Zone</b></p> 
<p>Located along Cyrodiil's southwest border and neighboring Valenwood and the Gold Coast, this new Chapter allows you to <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66003">explore West Weald</a>, a wealthy Imperial province thrown into chaos. Home to the proud and cosmopolitan Colovians, West Weald has found itself besieged by mysterious unknown Daedra. Even worse, a large part of the region has seemingly overnight become overgrown by the vast jungles of Valenwood, resulting in the migration of local Wood Elves. </p>
<a href="https://youtube.com/v/znogunEB5V0?autoplay=1&rel=0"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/znogunEB5V0/maxresdefault.jpg" /></a>
<p>Within this new zone, you can explore the city of Skingrad in addition to both the Gold Road region and emergent Dawnwood, where you'll discover a multitude of new side quests, world bosses, delves, public dungeons, and more. Discover more about the zone in <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66003">this preview blog</a>. </p> 
<p><b>Scribing System</b></p> 
<p>An all-new system introduced with <i>Gold Road</i>, Scribing grants you the ability to craft and <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66057">customize your own handmade abilities</a>. With Scribing, you can select a base Grimoire and tailor it with scripts to create an ability that perfectly fits your playstyle and build. </p>
<a href="https://youtube.com/v/_yWOpQ6_T0M?autoplay=1&rel=0"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_yWOpQ6_T0M/maxresdefault.jpg" /></a>
<p>With this new system, you'll discover a robust questline that has you restore an ancient Scholarium while diving deep into the mysteries of magicka in Tamriel. Whether you're looking for greater power, versatility, or roleplaying opportunities, Scribing introduces a powerful new way to tailor your builds and play your way. </p> 
<p><b>Group Activities</b></p> 
<p>In addition to the zone's multiple world bosses, delves, and public dungeons, <i>Gold Road</i> also introduces two new group activities to challenge you and your allies: the Lucent Citadel and Mirrormoor Incursions. </p> 
<p>In the Lucent Citadel Trial, you and your large group (12 players total) must venture into a long-forgotten Daedric vault within the realm of Fargrave, contend with its unique boss encounters, and seek out the mysterious Arcane Knot. </p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/05/82f94f90370d384feb55d981391e73aa.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Team up to defend West Weald</i></p> 
<p>Mirrormoor Incursions are a new type of world event plaguing West Weald and threatening to overwhelm the region with the minions of Ithelia. You can discover more about both activities in <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66085">this preview blog</a>. </p> 
<p><b>New Rewards</b></p> 
<p>In addition to a new zone to explore, stories to experience, and challenges to overcome, the <i>Gold Road</i> Chapter is full of new Achievements, items, and collectibles for you to loot and earn. </p> 
<p>Specifically, West Weald features 10 powerful item sets to loot and craft in addition to three unique Mythic items to uncover using the Antiquities system. Completing Achievements can also earn you a wide range of collectibles, such as style pages for King Nantharion's Royal Armor or even the Wildburn Lynx mount. </p>
<img src="https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/ape/uploads/2024/05/ad5fa21a49f122ad3b119ca16cf333b5.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>New collectibles, styles, and more</i></p> 
<p>Rewards also include fragments for the all-new Tales of Tribute patron and deck, Saint Alessia, in addition to a new type of collectible, called Skill Styles. Skill Styles are cosmetic collectibles that allow you to change the visuals for your existing abilities. With <i>Gold Road</i> and Update 42, there are 22 Skill Styles for you to unlock and apply from various sources, including quest rewards, public dungeons, and other activities. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Great challenges lead to great rewards!</i></p> 
<p>Finally, <i>Gold Road</i> and Update 42 also introduces the <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66017">Adventurer Across a Decade</a> Achievement, celebrating <i>ESO</i>'s 10-Year Anniversary by granting you the Fractured Glory skin for having completed the game's story content (including <i>Gold Road</i>) throughout its long history. </p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 20:22:11 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Following up on Studio Director Matt Firor's message last month about the <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/643289/update-on-current-and-future-status-of-gifting">current and future status of Crown Store Gifting</a>, we are moving forward with re-enabling this functionality for eligible players at the account level. In this post, we will detail what to expect.<br><br>
In September, we temporarily disabled Crown Store gifting due to a rapidly growing issue of "bad actors" using various fraudulent means to amass crowns without paying for them, then using them in turn to sell Crown Store items to players for real-world cash outside of the game client. That said, we recognize that gifting is a meaningful part of our community, and we are in the process of manually re-enabling Crown Store gifting access for select players who meet our specific criteria. This work will be complete tomorrow, October 11, during the maintenance window from 09:00 AM ET to 12:00 PM ET.<br><br>
Gifting eligibility is determined by an evolving list of factors including but not limited to the account being at least 180 days past its first login and previous engagement with in-game features. You may check if you have access to gifting in-game via the Crown Store as well as via <a href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/account/billing/billing-history">your billing history page</a> in the ESO account center. If you have access to Crown Store gifting, you will see "Allow Crown Store Gifting" in your billing history. If you try to send a gift via the in-game Crown Store and do not have access, you will see a "Gifting Locked" pop-up message. Please note that we are exploring better ways to display this information in-game in the future, such as updating the Gifting Tutorial.<br><br>
If you do not have access to Crown Store gifting after it is re-enabled on October 11, 2023, and wish for a review of your account, please visit <a href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com</a> and submit a Customer Support ticket. Please choose the Billing / Purchase / Code category then Platform &gt; I have a question about a sale / offer &gt; I want to send gift items from this account.<br><br>
We appreciate everyone's understanding and patience while we get this solution up and running. Multiple teams have worked long hours to evaluate the best technical solutions that we could stand up in a reasonably short time, while also prioritizing the Crown Store gifting player experience. We are dedicated to continuing to explore ways to make this better and reduce fraudulent activity in ESO. Thanks again for being a part of our community and for your continued support.]]></content:encoded>

After plenty of testing <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/discussion/632782/new-eso-launcher-testing-and-launch-plan-pc-and-mac">during the last PTS period</a>, we are pleased to announce the rollout of our new patcher on the live servers for PC/Mac. The rollout of the new patcher will happen in four phases, with new countries being added during each phase. As we give countries access to the new patcher, we will make note of it in the list below by noting next to the country name (has the new patcher.) We will also note what phase we are currently in by specifying whether it has not started, in progress, or complete, next to the phase number. The countries getting the patcher are listed in order below.<br><br>
Thanks for your patience as we roll this out to all countries listed below. A special thanks to everyone who helped test out the launcher during the last PTS and provided feedback.<br><br>
